1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Erin, hello!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, Beth!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's always good to see you.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, good to see you.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I was going to talk today about speckles.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
How do you feel about that?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Ooh, that sounds exciting.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Like, sparkles?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Do we can do sparkles?

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It can be sparkles.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I love sparkles.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yes.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
CellProfiler and sparkles are speckles, and I have a long history,

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
because the first thing I started using CellProfiler for in graduate school

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
was trying to find telomeres,

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
which are little bright dots in the nucleus.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And so I have a lot of history of figuring out how to try to make speckles nice in CellProfiler.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I would share a few tips and tricks.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yay! Can't wait.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
All right. So I pulled this data from the IDR,

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
one of our favorite places to find publicly available data.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And this is an experiment where they have nuclei,

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and they actually have four different colors of speckles.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So if I change these to grayscale,

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
speckle channel one,

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
this is nuclei,

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
another speckle channel,

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
another speckle channel,

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
another speckle channel.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Not necessarily all the same speckles.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah. I didn't mean to do that.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So here we have like these three dots that are right there.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Looks like we do have those same three dots in the next one,

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
but it's very different here.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So we have spots sort of in different things.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But it turns out that spots of something CellProfiler can do actually quite well.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So I have that data downloaded, just a sort of small subset of it,

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and let me pop in the CellProfiler project that I've already sort of precooked.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Except this is not the one for this episode.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Speckles. We're on speckles right now.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We believe in being prepared around here.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So...

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You're giving the illusion of it.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes. So here is my sort of pre-baked CellProfiler pipeline.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
All I've done ahead of time is to set up my names and types modules,

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and we'll put this pipeline up as we always do,

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
as well as the images that I'm using here.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And I've just thrown in a gray to color module,

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
not because we actually need it, but just to show you that, yep, there's our thing.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Here's all of our stuff. That's what it would all look like together,

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
but we don't actually need this. This is just for visualization.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But if we wanted to, say, put some outlines on things later, we could do that.

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah. I will point out to another place that one couldn't do that is in the Workspace viewer.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That is also a really handy way, you know, much like you just showed us in Fiji,

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
being able to toggle on and off the channels.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's certainly...

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I think both of us always just start in...

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Like, you have a new image, like we always just start in Fiji,

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
because that's really what it's meant for.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah. But just pointing out that CellProfiler does have the Workspace viewer

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and be handy for, especially as you're going through a pipeline,

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
if you already have images loaded in and you're working on them,

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
being able to toggle that as a workspace and not just in the modules as you go.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah. I like having gray to color, though, because what we can then do is

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
we can make overlays that we can save out.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And whenever you're doing something in CellProfiler,

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm always going to recommend that if you are identifying objects of any kind,

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
that you...

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What you go through is you go through and you actually save those outlines out,

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
because it's a really sad day when you have to go to your boss and tell them

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
that you've been chasing a segmentation error for three months,

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
because you didn't actually look at the segmentations you were doing,

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
because you had too many images. It's a bad day.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yes.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't be me.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So I'm going to just make some quick nuclei and cells here.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm going to drag this down, and I'm going to just turn it off for now,

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
because we don't actually need it now.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We don't probably need these, but it's nice to have them.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And how big are my nuclei?

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Should also change my visualization settings, which is a helpful thing to do.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So CellProfiler has these visualization settings,

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
where you can set what the default thing is in terms of being able to see.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The last project I was working on was really dark,

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and so log normalization was helpful to make it so the images were actually visible.

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Normalize the CellProfiler's default, though,

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and for most things, it works pretty well.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
There we go.

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh, look at that.

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So if I want to get a sense of how big my objects are,

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm going to just grab CellProfiler's length measurement tool,

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and I'm going to click and drag across this nucleus

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and get an idea of about how big it is.

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So it's about 100-ish pixels in diameter.

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So that is going to help me.

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This should be pretty easy to segment, I'm guessing,

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:32,000
because these are sort of gorgeous nuclei.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah, gorgeous.

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm going to just change this bottom number a little bit,

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
because it's oversegmenting them a little bit.

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Beautiful.

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Look at that.

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Wow.

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Nuclear is so nice.

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So lovely.

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And I mean, look at CellProfiler,

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
just by taking in a couple little settings,

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
it's able to output default parameters that find your nuclei.

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah.

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And just so that then we could associate spots with cells or something like cells,

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
we don't have a whole cell channel here.

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I mean, some of these you can kind of like squint

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and maybe see the cytoplasm.

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't know if I'd trust it that much though.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But what I can do real fast is if I want to make some sort of pseudo cells,

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and maybe in fact I'll even name them that,

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I can use CellProfiler's distance B method,

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
which involves saying, I'm going to make an object

120
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
and then I'm going to draw a donut around it.

121
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And...

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Why did that not work?

123
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh, because I want a distance and not distance B.

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So distance B is make donuts,

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
but also threshold into areas that are threshold positive.

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And CellProfiler quite rightly was like,

127
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
there's nothing threshold positive outside of what you've already identified.

128
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Touche CellProfiler, Touche.

129
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So here are my expanded pseudo cells.

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Easy peasy.

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
These should be good enough.

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
All right.

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
A couple things about making speckle images.

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The first thing that is super helpful for you to know when you do this

135
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
is that there is a module called Enhance or Suppress Features.

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Enhance or Suppress Features allows you to either enhance

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
or suppress features in your images.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Whoa.

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Crazy naming system you've got here, Beth.

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So what you can do amongst various different kinds of things

141
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
is Enhanced Speckles, which is what we're going to do here.

142
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And we can tell it, hey, my speckles are about this size.

143
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Anything that's bigger than that, I don't want.

144
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And now this looks like nothing.

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Because it is very dim, which is why we should reset our normalization settings again.

146
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So let's figure out what those might be, what are some good normalization settings here.

147
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Normalization with a parameter of five.

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That sounds great.

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And if I apply to both of them, that should hopefully work.

150
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So you can see already even just a little bit, but now let's try to make it much more obvious.

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So it's not uncommon, at least in my workflow, to be changing this.

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What is my default display setting several times throughout the course of building pipeline.

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And it just makes life faster.

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Anything that makes a step that you're going to do a bunch of times faster, like configuring things,

155
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
the better your life will get.

156
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So now we can see that we have this spot that was previously on the background of a whole bunch of stuff that now we can barely even see anything because all of that background has gone away and we just have to do it.

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So we have this spot that has gone away and we just have our lovely little spot.

158
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It looks like we now don't have anything, but in fact we do have things. We just mostly have lovely little spots.

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I suspect that that is going to be good, but we'll take advantage here of the workspace viewer and the fact that the workspace viewer has a property that the rest of CellProfiler does not have, which is when you

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:54,000
rerun a module, CellProfiler will default to just showing you go back to sort of the zoomed out view.

161
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What if you want to stay on the zoomed in view?

162
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The workspace viewer is actually really helpful for that.

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And so here's what the sort of very zoomed out version looks like with our current settings.

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I want to just sort of change my feature size just to get a quick sense of if this got better or worse.

165
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I now have to go back and find that same thing over here, which would be hard, but in the workspace viewer it stays in the same place.

166
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That looks worse to me if I go to 15.

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's an interesting bug.

168
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
All right.

169
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Ten was working.

170
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's funny.

171
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I feel like you and I both have used enhancer suppressed features a lot, but that's the beauty of live demonstrations, like finding bugs that we've never found before.

172
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Ten seems good.

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
We're going to go with ten.

174
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Okay.

175
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So if I then wanted, I could do the exact same thing by just using sub-profilers to duplicate functionality and just make spots the same size of all of my channels.

176
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Now, it might be, I don't actually know the biology here that we would expect that some of these RNA foci would be bigger in some cases than others.

177
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't know why we would expect that, but if we did, I could go through and I could adjust this feature size.

178
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And yeah, we can definitely see in some of these brighter ones.

179
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Seems like one was our dimmest one to start with.

180
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Just how much, like we are keeping our real signal, but everything else just sort of like goes away in a way that is super lovely.

181
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And that is also something, again, with here we're sort of guessing at the biology because that's not really what matters for this demonstration.

182
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We're demonstrating proof of principle here, but in any situation you want a biologist with actual domain knowledge that can tell you about what they're looking for because perhaps some of that tiny, tiny graininess,

183
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:23,000
maybe there are spots that are only one or two pixels wide in those images that actually do matter to capture, or maybe it's really only the bright, hunkin' 20 pixel wide foci that are way fewer and that are actually what we want to find.

184
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And so being able to talk to the biologist or get more information about the biology we actually want is an important thing when you're extracting actual information.

185
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah.

186
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I now want to sort of talk about, that was all incredibly good point.

187
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The one other thing I want to sort of point out in regards to speckles, it's going to be helpful for me to show you what the image histograms look like.

188
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So here's the image histogram from our nuclear channel.

189
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You can see that we have low pixel intensity, which is our background, we have lots of pixels, and then we have the sort of second bump.

190
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Cool.

191
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Great.

192
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What does it look like, especially once we have speckle adjusted our images?

193
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yeah, we don't have that here.

194
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So most thresholding algorithms operate on the principle of that you're going to have two or sometimes more of these peaks.

195
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And what they're trying to do is to figure out, you know, where do these peaks cross.

196
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
If you don't have that, how do you actually properly threshold your image?

197
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So so profiler has a neat little thing that anchorpenter actually invented the start holding method true story.

198
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I didn't realize that.

199
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah.

200
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Where it has a special thresholding method called robust background, which is great for when your image is mostly background.

201
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So,

202
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I did not realize that for a long time either.

203
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So I think our speckles are probably going to be between sort of like two and 10 pixels.

204
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That's going to be my initial guess.

205
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And actually, I'm going to start with like one brighter ones.

206
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm going to start with channel three because why not?

207
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So the way robust background works is it says, all right, I'm going to clip off the very dimmest pixels and the very brightest pixels.

208
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And I'm going to figure out sort of then after that, like, what is the mean and of that distribution that is left.

209
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And then say how many standard deviations above the mean would you like to say is your threshold.

210
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And so if your stuff is super bright, sometimes I've set this as high as like 10 standard deviations and start with something more reasonable like four.

211
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But hopefully this is going to do a lovely job of picking out just our speckles and nothing else.

212
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
All right.

213
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So here we actually do really have super lovely signal where even four standard deviations above the mean of the background is still picking up a lot of cred because our spots are just so so bright.

214
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So for standard deviations above the mean is giving us about 0.008.

215
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Our actual pixels are like 0.06.

216
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
They're way they're 0.1 in some cases they are way brighter than that.

217
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And all I have to do is say more standard deviations.

218
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So let's say 10.

219
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And would you ever bump the outlier fraction.

220
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yes, potentially.

221
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So if you know that your image has like some auto fluorescence or some crud in it that you really want to sort of work around, you can change that outlier fraction.

222
00:15:46,000 --> 00:16:10,000
More often than not though what I have found is if you're changing if you're in regime where you're changing the outlier fraction that means that enough of your image is signal such that you should probably just switch their shoulder methods so sometimes I will play around with that if it seems like we're pretty close to sort of having something where we have a single peak after clipping that is only our background.

223
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But I with time and experience I have done that less and less.

224
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
All right, this looks great.

225
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Again, if we sort of really understood the biology we're studying here we would know if we want these sort of bigger things or not.

226
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm just going to err on the side of assuming that we do and I'm actually just going to turn off the discard objects outside the diameter range.

227
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But yeah, we now have our gorgeous little speckles.

228
00:16:40,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And so what usually we will want is some kind of, you know, measurement of our speckles maybe so in our speckles channel three I might want to get all of my different unprocessed want to clarify always want sort of unprocessed when we're doing measurements.

229
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And then what I can do is I can use the relate objects module to say I have these cells and they're going to have speckles inside them.

230
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And I want to know how many speckles and what is the average speckle intensity or whatever measurements I've made for each cell.

231
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So that way I can know if there's something about my cell like maybe big cells have brighter speckles or maybe there's something about ones that have super bright speckles in channel three.

232
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And so to just sort of show you in the workspace viewer what that looks like.

233
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I now just pull up my DNA image.

234
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I can show you my pseudo cells.

235
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I can show you my channel three speckles and I can throw the that other speckle channel on here.

236
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Just so that we can sort of see what that looks like.

237
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But then I can also do things like say, hey for each cell show me how many speckles are in it.

238
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And I probably don't need that to for significant digits.

239
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yeah, now I know for every cell how many speckles it has and if I zoom in.

240
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yeah, that looks to me like I've caught things.

241
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Awesome.

242
00:18:44,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So if this were really my biology, all I would basically then do is sort of duplicate this module three more times, duplicate this module three more times, address my objects here, and then make some outline channels so that I could go through and actually take a look to see.

243
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But in the interest of time, you can see that in many of our other videos, those sorts of things, but this, the sort of tricks around how do you do speckle enhancement, and what is the best kind of thresholding for speckle enhancement or what is really special about this workflow in particular.

244
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You can also check out our example speckles pipeline on self or rather or slash examples, which has a speckle example that you can download and try but you can always download this pipeline in these images from our website.

245
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And add here.

246
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:40,000
No, I mean, I think very sparkly. I mean, just, you know, I, I happen to like workflows where you identify a lot of objects, especially the outlines because you can give each of them a different color.

247
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And then you have these like, I mean, I think you like, I had a workflow or basically told me it was too psychedelic you couldn't interpret any of my object outlines because there were too many objects and too many colors and you've never guessed that that was the thing I liked.

248
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:07,000
But, but again, a handy thing to remember that it can be really helpful for interpreting after the fact what your outputs are and what you're seeing.

249
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yeah, realistically, with this many channels, what I would probably do is rather than putting the object overlays on a color image, I would make four different overlays one for each channel, just so that I could then really interpret them, especially because it seems like we have bleed between some of them.

250
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yeah.

251
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Yeah, but definitely something you can, you know, you can play with depending on what your, what your biology is right like your question can inform what you're doing if really what matters to you is just count.

252
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Then that may be a very different, very different sort of object overlays that you would look for.

253
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:49,000
If you were looking for more complex relationships, more, you know, intensity based relationships.

254
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And, and so your biologist knowledge, again, it would be very important for for the final choices that you make in such a pipeline.

255
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Great.

256
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Great. Thanks for hanging out with me Erin while I did this.

257
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Going back to old times and thinking about speckles again.

258
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Yeah, thanks for bringing sparkles into Ask Erin Dear Beth.

259
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Always. See you later.

260
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Bye.
