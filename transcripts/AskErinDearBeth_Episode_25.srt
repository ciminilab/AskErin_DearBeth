00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello Beth.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:18,800
Hello Erin, always lovely to see you.

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,800
I agree.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:28,280
Yeah, so recently we actually gave a quick overview, well as quick as I'm able to do

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,280
when I'm talking about it.

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,800
Of the Cell Painting Assay.

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:41,440
And so today I thought it would be interesting to dive into like what do Cell Painting features

8
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,440
mean.

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:53,000
There's a lot of discussion in particularly, you know, right now in morphological profiling,

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,200
which again as I sort of said in the Cell Painting episode is kind of like the omics

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,160
of looking at cell shape that we're doing in Cell Painting Assay.

12
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,160
And.

13
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,560
And intensity and textures and crazy.

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,840
Yes, yes, absolutely.

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,840
Yeah.

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,960
But in our, I mean, I think in probably in every field, but I can only speak knowledgeably

17
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,960
about our particular field, you know, there's lots of discussion at the moment of like,

18
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,120
okay, everybody wants to do deep learning.

19
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:30,080
And one of the major drawbacks of many deep learning techniques is that the features that

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,240
come out at the end that are, you know, describing your condition are not interpretable.

21
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,440
And so the Cell Painting Assay and the sort of more traditional features that we're getting

22
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,240
out of CellProfiler are quite interpretable.

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:55,000
And so I thought it would be helpful though to kind of like dive into the feature names

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,880
and explain like, great, people say, oh yeah, CellProfiler is interpretable, but like,

25
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,360
how do we actually interpret them?

26
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,000
Let's look at them.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:16,040
So yeah, with that, I am sharing here, this is a page in, so the 2023 Simony Nature Protocols

28
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:28,480
paper was a giant work led by my dear, dear Beth right here.

29
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,680
That was optimizing the Cell Painting Assay.

30
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,160
So this is the second time that we had a major protocol paper published on the Cell Painting

31
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,160
assay.

32
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,880
But here in this repository, and we'll drop the Lincoln show notes, we have a wiki that

33
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:50,680
has just sort of some extra like casual, more casual information about the Cell Painting

34
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
assay.

35
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,920
And one of the things we have in here is what do Cell Painting features even mean?

36
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,080
And so I thought this was just a great thing to like scroll through chat through and explain

37
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,080
what they mean.

38
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,880
Well, and because I mean capable of taking credit for anything, this is basically copied

39
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:16,160
verbatim from like the wiki for the Cell Painting v2 paper and was built over like many years

40
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,280
by lots of people.

41
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,920
This is not a thing that I personally made.

42
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,640
But it is a really great resource that the lab has made over the years.

43
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,640
Yes.

44
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,640
Yeah.

45
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,480
All right, fine.

46
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,080
You can refuse to take credit, sole credit on this.

47
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,560
Didn't mean to, but yeah, did not mean to imply this was all the last work because so

48
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:44,160
many fabulous, wonderful scientists have worked to lead us to this point.

49
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,160
Yes.

50
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:51,120
But it is in a repository for the paper that that led.

51
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,560
So that is true.

52
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,680
I'm just I'm just putting that out there.

53
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,680
Okay.

54
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,680
Here we go.

55
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,840
So if you need a refresher on the Cell Painting Assay, you know, go go check out the that episode

56
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,120
will drop it in in show notes.

57
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,160
But basically, we as a reminder, we have pictures of cells.

58
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,840
We identify nuclei.

59
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,720
We identify cell bodies.

60
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,680
We define the cytoplasm, which is the cell minus the nucleus.

61
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:29,160
And then there are a number of channels that we are making measurements in.

62
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:37,040
So we are identifying the cell, for example, and then making a whole series of measurements

63
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,760
using that same object.

64
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,040
So one thing I want to emphasize here is that the object that we are identifying, we may

65
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,680
use some comBINAtion of channels for identifying like a cell object.

66
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,680
But then that object is independent of the channels that we used to identify it.

67
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,800
It is just now like a mathematical squiggle, right?

68
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,040
And we're saying, okay, now I can place that squiggle on top of any of these images and

69
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,400
make measurements about what is inside that squiggle.

70
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,840
Sorry, in any of, yeah, in any of these images independently of what I used to create that

71
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,840
cell object.

72
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,400
Yeah, that's a super important point to emphasize.

73
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Yeah.

74
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,600
So we have these five channels.

75
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
We give them names.

76
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:35,720
Usually we name them based on what we are looking at, the expected structure.

77
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:43,320
So DNA, RNA, ER, mito, AGP, standing for actin, Golgi, and plasma membrane.

78
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:50,000
So that is our description for the image itself, because it's the structure that we are expecting

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,520
to see in that image based on the stain that should be showing in that channel that we

80
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,800
imaged.

81
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:08,520
We have, right, so then many, many, many measurements, thousands of measurements.

82
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:14,320
And yeah, this is an older version, because back then we were only doing like 2000 features,

83
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,200
and now we tend to do closer to like 8000.

84
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Yeah.

85
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Yeah.

86
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,840
And it's kind of, it's kind of nuts.

87
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,840
All the things.

88
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,320
I like it.

89
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,320
Yeah.

90
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:35,360
So we then, again, we take measurements in individual channels, in the different objects,

91
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,360
and then we can also make extra measurements, right, that are features looking at the relationship

92
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,800
between channels.

93
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:50,480
So that's an extra set where we then have correlation features that then are describing

94
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,800
multiple channels, the mathematical relationship between information and multiple images within

95
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,400
those objects.

96
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,280
So yeah, I mentioned we have the cells, the cytoplasm and the nuclei as our objects, and

97
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:09,200
then we have a bunch of categories of features that we're measuring.

98
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:17,040
So these are links to the CellProfiler documentation telling you more details about the exact measurements

99
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,160
in each of these categories.

100
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,960
But just to note, you know, there are different categories of measurements, and they can be

101
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,880
things such as shape, area shape, describing, that's not actually looking at fluorescent,

102
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,880
you know, pixel intensities, it's telling you just about the shape itself, but then

103
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:45,520
something like intensity, like that's telling us all about pixel intensities within that

104
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,920
shape, and often includes things that are quite simple, like the total intensity or

105
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,480
the mean pixel intensity within there.

106
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,120
But it can also be more complex, like talking about the distribution or the patterns of

107
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,960
those intensities.

108
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,640
So sort of a full range of like very easily understandable to like, actually I can wave

109
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:13,640
my hands and tell you what it's doing, but it's, but digging into the very specifics

110
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,800
is complicated.

111
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:23,480
And then some of these, like texture and granularity, again, are quite easily on a sort of conceptual

112
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,960
level of we're looking at how much texture is in an image.

113
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,920
And you know, granularity is if I erode a part of the image, you know, a piece at a

114
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,560
time, how much is left.

115
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:40,160
So it's also kind of like a very similar to a texture conceptually, but mathematically

116
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,680
quite different.

117
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,400
And mathematically, you know, so we get the sort of like the biologist hand waving, oh,

118
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:53,240
it's looking at texture, but in terms of like, what does that mean?

119
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,760
You know, there's a bit of a disconnect.

120
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,760
Likewise.

121
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,680
So I think also talking about interpretability, like these all are interpretable in that we

122
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,800
can tell you the exact math.

123
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,760
So lots of deep learning is a black box of what math is happening here.

124
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,240
We can tell you the exact math, like you can go to the CellProfiler code, you can look

125
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,320
and see like what are numbers.

126
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:21,040
Yeah, if you really want to, you know, what numbers go in and what numbers come out.

127
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,360
Um, and, but a biologist is going to have a much easier time telling you like, oh, cell

128
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,960
area, like I know exactly what that means.

129
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:37,440
At first it's like, oh, the granularity, you know, of this structure in this, you know,

130
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,440
like it gets a little more hand wavy what that could actually mean.

131
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,920
So, but so that is, we have these feature categories, different kinds of measurements.

132
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:53,400
Um, also some of them have extra things tacked on the end.

133
00:09:53,400 --> 00:10:01,000
Um, so like, Xernikis, those are a math, a math for describing.

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,320
I was going to say, maybe we should do a Xerniki episode someday, but no, we probably should

135
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
not.

136
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,120
Maybe you could do a Xerniki episode.

137
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,920
Um, I mean, I do think like, I think that would actually be awesome.

138
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,400
It's, it's really interesting what he's doing.

139
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:22,120
I understand it to the level of it's telling us, you know, how, how things are, it is math

140
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,920
that tells us like how things were arranged.

141
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,840
Um, I think that's all you need to know.

142
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,680
I think you just did the Xerniki episode.

143
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
Congratulations.

144
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,880
Um, but so, you know, some features, right, have different parameters at the very end

145
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:43,400
of the feature name saying like, okay, this is, um, additional, additional pieces of information

146
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,200
and you need to know mathematically, you know, to understand the math.

147
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,880
Um, so like the scale at which these things are measured.

148
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:58,360
Um, so that is like how we get to these features in a nutshell.

149
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,000
And then, um, I just wanted to show like, I can show you really quickly.

150
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,680
Um, just a few examples, you know, of, we can just dive into a couple of features here.

151
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,760
Um, do, do, do.

152
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,440
So, um, you know, here is opening an Excel.

153
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,480
So it's not the most beautiful, but if we, okay, see, I know, ah, there we go.

154
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,880
Um, to make this readable, you know, just picking some random features here.

155
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,040
Um, again, this is just totally at random, but the way that we under, so all of the

156
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,600
Excel profiler features are named in a consistent way.

157
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:51,680
So we, it starts by telling you what compartment, um, this was what object this was measured in.

158
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,400
So we measured it in the object we call the cells.

159
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,120
Then this is the category, um, of measurement that we made.

160
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,160
So we made a texture measurement.

161
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,040
This is the specific measurement that we made.

162
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:12,960
I don't know what an info measurement one is necessarily other than it is one math.

163
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,600
So just for the texture.

164
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:22,240
Um, then it's telling us the name of the image that we measured it in.

165
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:29,640
So again, we named this image actin because it was the structure that we expected to see

166
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,360
given our stains.

167
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,640
You could name it what you can name it whatever.

168
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,440
There's many ways that one could name, but this is our standard for the Cell Painting.

169
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,120
Um, and then this is just some extra parameters that have to do with the info measure one.

170
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,960
Oh, this is a fun example.

171
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,960
And this leads right into why don't I want to say, okay, so this is saying, um, within the nuclei.

172
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,840
Um, we measured an intensity feature.

173
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,520
That specific feature is the standard deviation of the intensity at the edge of the object.

174
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,640
And we measured it in the actin channel.

175
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,000
But wait, you might say there shouldn't be any actin within the nucleus.

176
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,720
What?

177
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,280
That doesn't make any sense.

178
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:16,960
And so here I think this is a really important point that I want to make, um, about, uh, about

179
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,320
CellProfiler features.

180
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,320
So we will get questions about this.

181
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,120
Like, okay, but how is that interpretable?

182
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,480
You can't interpret actin in the nucleus.

183
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,400
There is no actin within the nucleus.

184
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,320
But wait a little bit, but you shouldn't be effected and shouldn't be fluid.

185
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,640
And we should not see effected within the nucleus.

186
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:41,680
So what I want to point out is here, this beautiful illustration, I clearly spent hours on, you know,

187
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,400
um, I love it.

188
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:43,880
Yeah.

189
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,280
Yeah.

190
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,040
Absolutely.

191
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,440
You know, not to scale, but if we think of, we have an objective and we have a cell growing

192
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,360
on a cover slip and what, you know, so cells, even the beautiful, even cell

193
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,280
cells that are beautiful for microscopy that like pancake out nice and flat for imaging,

194
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,600
even those kinds of cells, they are in three dimensions.

195
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,320
Um, yeah, like, whoa, we don't live in flatland cells are three dimensional.

196
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:18,600
Um, so what that means is, um, in this example, I have blue nucleus and I have some cellular

197
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,280
compartment we can pretend it's ER, you know, that's like perinuclear here.

198
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,880
Um, I mean, it's red, so it's the mitochondria, but sure.

199
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,440
I know.

200
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,120
I know.

201
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,440
Okay.

202
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:28,720
Right.

203
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:28,960
I know.

204
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,640
My nose is red.

205
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,680
Um, so, you know, uh, it's some unknown cellular structure here.

206
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,160
Um, yeah.

207
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,880
But if we look at that from the top, what we see is that, um, so we have, you know,

208
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,080
can clearly see the nucleus is this nice round thing here in the middle of the cell from

209
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,760
the top, the majority of the signal.

210
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,120
Yes.

211
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,880
The majority of this red is going to show up as in a circle around the nucleus, but

212
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,160
because the cell is three dimensional, there is actually some structure that when we are,

213
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,200
you know, looking sort of the top view or I guess a bottom view, because we have a bottom

214
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:14,080
here, bottom view of the cell, um, you know, you do see some of this compartment that is

215
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,000
outside of the cell, um, looks like it's overlapping with the nucleus.

216
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,400
And so when we're looking at features here, these measured features, so hooks tends to

217
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,960
be a very nice tight stain that doesn't drift cytoplasmically.

218
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,920
So we'll see, you know, the intensity of our DNA within the cell.

219
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,480
We basically see nothing.

220
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,400
And if we look at the intensity of the DNA within the nucleus, it's very, very bright.

221
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,360
And if we look here at my pretend ER, that even though it's ER should be, you know,

222
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,520
green and my door, red, bear with me.

223
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,200
So I have very particular feelings about what color different organ.

224
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,000
I know it's kind of ridiculous, but also like, yeah, it is what it is.

225
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,080
Um, so then if we look in the cell, we see, right, like clearly that makes sense.

226
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,840
We see the ER here is mostly perinuclear.

227
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,240
Like that's biologically true.

228
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:13,040
But then if I look at features in measured in the nucleus, right, because it is this,

229
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,680
you know, it is this object that is a circle of a, you know, a three dimensional

230
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,400
compressed thing.

231
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:27,560
Like we're seeing some of this stain is actually, actually there in our nucleus

232
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:36,440
object, which doesn't reflect completely real biology, you know, nucleus, like in the

233
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:42,200
cell, we don't have endoplasmic reticulum inside of the nucleus in a cell.

234
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,920
But our stain, because we're going from 3D to 2D measurements, we will measure some

235
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,120
there.

236
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,520
So that's how to interpret.

237
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,240
If you get this sort of nonsensical feature, um, well, yeah, go back.

238
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,800
Can you go back to the, I just want to make one microscopy point, which is like, and

239
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,960
some of this has to do with sort of how thick of what's called an optical section that

240
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,480
we're taking.

241
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:05,880
Yeah.

242
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,320
So we tend to do Cell Painting in wide field, though you can't do it in either

243
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,440
wide field or confocal.

244
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,560
And what that means is if I draw on Erin's lovely drawing here with my

245
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:21,120
annotator, um, with wide field microscopy, you don't tend to get a lot of Z

246
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,760
resolution.

247
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,000
You tend to take light from a lot of different Z points in your sample.

248
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,560
And so that's why we have this effect.

249
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,360
If we really, really, really, really, really only wanted a very thin one, if we

250
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,720
did something like confocal microscopy, we could take a thinner Z section and then

251
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,440
we wouldn't see much or at all of this stuff that's on top of the nucleus.

252
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,880
Um, but for Cell Painting, we typically want to gather as much information as possible.

253
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,640
And so that's why generally we prefer to use wide field so that we get more of

254
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,720
the stuff, even if it makes it a little bit more jumbled, because we're seeing a

255
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,000
three thing compressed into 2d, but it is totally possible to take a thin section

256
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,960
where this doesn't happen.

257
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,600
If that's what you want for whatever asset you're doing.

258
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,280
Yeah.

259
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,040
Absolutely.

260
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,720
Good point.

261
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,440
And, you know, we can go, like, we'll also coming up soon have an episode about, like,

262
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,520
how can you modify the Cell Painting Assay and, you know, and talk about wide

263
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,600
field versus confocal.

264
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,520
Um, but in terms of, you know, what is our, our standard Cell Painting Assay is

265
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,320
wide field.

266
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,400
So we are getting all of this extra, all of this extra information, but like, again,

267
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,240
great point.

268
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,440
It could be handled differently such that you could, um, end up.

269
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,240
With, you know, with different, a different way of imaging here.

270
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,520
Um, this is just not what we're usually working with.

271
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,880
Um, yeah.

272
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,600
It's a great point.

273
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,960
And I think that's what I wanted to say about CellProfiler features and

274
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,480
understanding and interpreting them.

275
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,520
Yeah.

276
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,320
No.

277
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,640
And, and definitely some of them will give you a picture in your head.

278
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,240
Like if I say my cell got has an area two times as big, you know, to your point

279
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,520
earlier, like some of the things definitely like the picture, like the info

280
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,720
measure, it's like, okay, the texture is kind of something about this, but I

281
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,440
don't really, but it should be enough to at least give you an idea of like what's

282
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,880
going on in the cell to try to give you idea of what's the next experiment to do.

283
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,680
Yes.

284
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,080
Yeah.

285
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,320
And certainly way more informative than, you know, feature 732, which might be the

286
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,400
name of the future you would get out of a deep learning model.

287
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:29,680
Right.

288
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,400
Like, um, so there is definitely always.

289
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,160
Some level of interpretability because you know what image, you know, what

290
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,680
compartment, um, and what category of measurement it is, even if it's, even if

291
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,400
it's not to get there is, is a big.

292
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:49,960
Awesome.

293
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,400
Well, thank you.

294
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,920
That was great.

295
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,560
And I love, I love your illustration.

296
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,160
Thank you.

297
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,840
Thank you.

298
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,120
Um, thanks for being here and thanks for joining.

299
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,080
Talk to you later.
