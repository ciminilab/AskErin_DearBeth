00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hi!

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
How are you today?

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I am excited for another episode of Ask Erin Dear Beth.

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
How about you?

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What a coincidence.

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I am too.

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Here we are.

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I thought I would talk about plugins today.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So plugins for CellProfiler.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Why might I want to talk about plugins today?

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, let me tell you why I want to talk about plugins today.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So you know that CellProfiler has many, many, many, many modules.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
About a hundred.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah, yeah.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's a lot.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It has a lot of things.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
CellProfiler does a lot.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It turns out CellProfiler does even more than a lot because we have an entire,

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I know, we have an entire extra repository of CellProfiler plugins that are basically

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:18,000
the idea is that it is more modules that are either experimental or like community contributed.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So we welcome your contributions or sort of a work in progress.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Like maybe we're testing it out and eventually want to move it into the main CellProfiler

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
repository, you know, to be packaged with, you know, as a regular module and CellProfiler,

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
but we're not quite ready yet.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Or maybe it's something that's super niche.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Like we know this is really important for a very specific workflow.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I end up being that, you know, that sort of user where, you know, like really, really important extra utility for very specific workflows,

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
but not actually something the vast majority of users would use.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So we keep them in the plugins repo or plugins that we think have a high likelihood of being accidentally used in a way that would be damaging to, you know, a quantitative image analysis workflow if the user didn't fully understand what they were doing.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So we keep them separately as well.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So I kind of capture.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I just you've used the word repository and then the word repo a couple times and I want to like ask you what you mean by that.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Well, let's dive right into that.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So here we this is the CellProfiler plugins repository also shortened to repo.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And this is this is on GitHub for people who are not not familiar with sort of this this more computational realm.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm going to talk you through how you actually get this code.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So basically this is a place where we store code.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And in fact, you know, CellProfiler, this is the CellProfiler organization and here is the CellProfiler repository, all of the code to run CellProfiler to make CellProfiler entirely is here in this repository so you can click through and find, you know, if you click through you will find things in like, well, that's not a very exciting Python file.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You know, you can click through and find and find all the code that is used to make CellProfiler likewise here with plugins.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What we have here is in active plugins, each of these is all of the code to run a single new plugin, aka, you know, fancy module within CellProfiler.

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But if you are not comfortable working with code.

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You know, what if I don't want to look at this code.

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If you don't want to look at this, you don't need to look at this.

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yay, that's what I was hoping you were going to say.

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So the only thing that you need to do is to go here to this code button, and it will give you this this URL to copy.

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And now this is like, so here is my terminal.

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This is a command line.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So this is, you have to have a tiny, tiny, tiny bit of computational comfort.

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But if this feels overwhelming to you, go ask a friend.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You can also download the whole repo as a zip.

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We can.

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh, here.

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So you don't even need to do that.

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay.

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So forget what I said.

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You don't even need to make friends.

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Don't make friends.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Friends are good, especially if you want to then grab updated versions of the plugins later, having this cloned with what is called get on your computer can be really helpful.

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But if the terminal is just a no for you and you don't have a friend right now, you can hit downloads it.

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yeah, so if we do that, it then downloaded to my downloads folder.

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And here, this is CellProfiler plugins.

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This folder here now in my downloads folder.

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So then from CellProfiler, let's from CellProfiler, all to be able to run plugins.

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Open up a fresh one here, but you don't necessarily need to all you need to be able to do is in your preferences.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Then if you go here, you see this CellProfiler plugins directory browse to where you downloaded your downloaded your repository repository, your plugins repo.

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And set that location.

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So here, I already have CellProfiler plugins up and running.

71
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So I'm not actually going to change that location, but I could all I would have to do right is browse into my downloads and set this here as my active plugins.

72
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So the download the active plugins folder.

73
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That that seems manageable.

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I feel like I can do that.

75
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah.

76
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah.

77
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I know you can.

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And I know that any of our users are CellProfiler users watching this can too.

79
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So what that means then is once that happens now all of and once you reboot CellProfiler and once you reboot CellProfiler.

80
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yes, I meant to say that that's important.

81
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Thank you, Beth.

82
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So once you have set your new plugins location, you need to close CellProfiler and open it back up again.

83
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Very important.

84
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But then any of this list of active plugins are now available in your modules here.

85
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So you can see that I have, you know, there's a list of a list of plugins here that are now visible that are not what you would normally find available.

86
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And so really like that's it that opens up this whole new realm of possibilities of plugins.

87
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I will point out because documentation is my jam yo that we do have some some pretty nice documentation if I do say so myself so you can get there from the you know we'll link it in our show notes.

88
00:07:46,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You can get there from the, you know, from the plugins repo page as well and this talks you through again, reminds you what are the plugins, how do you use them.

89
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It has some additional information about installation for some of these plugins.

90
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So most of the plugins here we have currently, you know, in our supported plugins, most of them you will notice in this column of requires installation of dependencies, most of them the answer is no.

91
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So that means you do not need to do anything else to make these plugins run.

92
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:45,000
They're ready. Some of them say, yes, and these are most likely to be the modules that are bringing in deep learning tools like run Cellpose.

93
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So that means what that means is that Cellpose needs to be downloaded and installed onto your computer.

94
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So does CellProfiler in order to be able to run this, but I do want to point out that for some of ours plugins that require extra dependencies and we're working on getting to the all point, but some of them.

95
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So I don't even actually have to go through the extra steps of installing that all you need to do is have an application called Docker desktop, and we're also currently working on supporting other options beyond just Docker.

96
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Currently, it's very easy with Docker. So all I did was opened it up. I didn't even have to set anything in the software I just needed to make sure it was open.

97
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So then if I want to use RunCellpose in my module, what I can do is select RunCellpose in Docker. So instead of saying in my Python environment, which means Cellpose needs to be actually installed in my computer, which can be challenging.

98
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I mean, I will say that challenging for people who even have computational backgrounds, I don't actually currently have an environment on my laptop right now where I can run Cellpose and CellProfiler together.

99
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Like, it can be messy, which is one of the reasons that we have made this work around.

100
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So even fairly computationally comfortable people still like me still like this Docker work around. And what that means is that when I choose to use this plugin RunCellpose that does have extra dependencies, it needs the Cellpose software.

101
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I can tell it look in my Docker and Docker, which I won't go into I'm not going to go into the details now but you can say conceptually the software is packaged in a nice box for me within Docker, and I can select the version that I want.

102
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And it will then use that nicely packaged in a box version to send my image to that box, run it in Cellpose in that box and send the information back to me so that I can run Cellpose within CellProfiler without having to actually install the dependencies.

103
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So that's another like cool important thing that we have done. And we are continuing to expand upon for especially, you know, deep learning and AI tools that are extra hard to install. So another like important part of our plugin ecosystem here.

104
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Very hard to install sadly.

105
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes, yes. You know, we also have a publication describing it.

106
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Drop the link to that in the show notes if you want to read more.

107
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But yeah, if you're the kind of person who likes to read stuff first, go read the publication and our lovely documentation if you're the kind of person who likes to dive right in.

108
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Go for it, because I just showed you how to do it. And you now have opened, you know, opened up a whole new world of new modules that you can use in CellProfiler.

109
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Amazing. Yeah, I think so. So that's that CellProfiler plugins.

110
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I love it. That's so great. It brings so many other functionalities to CellProfiler, which already has so many functionalities but now it has even more.

111
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, and really, I think helps hit home both that CellProfiler is an important tool for bio image analysis or image analysis in general but you know, we're biologists so that's what we focus on.

112
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So it's an important image analysis tool but also you can think of it as a workflow manager tool as well because it has the ability to call out to other softwares, particularly through our plugins ecosystem.

113
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Awesome. Thank you so much for sharing that with us. That's great.

114
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yes, my pleasure. Thanks for joining me. Bye.
