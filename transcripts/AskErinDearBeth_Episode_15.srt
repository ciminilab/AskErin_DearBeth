1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey, how's it going?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:19,800
Hello, uh, lovely to see you, Mediar.

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,240
Yeah, all things a pleasure.

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,440
I thought today it would be fun to talk about images that look bad.

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,440
Oh!

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,440
Oh!

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,040
That's an interesting take, because usually we're all about the pretty pictures.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,560
Okay, what do you got for me?

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,400
I mean, I love when the pictures are pretty.

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,960
The fact of the matter is, just like sometimes the pictures are not pretty or just like,

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,680
you don't understand what they look like at all.

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:53,000
And so, um, I wanted to talk about what are some of the cases we've come across the most,

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,320
where people are like, why does the picture look like that?

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,200
And actually explain why the picture looks like that.

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,720
Sounds great.

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,720
Let's do it.

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,720
Okay.

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,480
I'm going to go ahead and share my screen.

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,160
Okey-dokey.

20
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,200
So, here's the most common one.

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,760
So common, in fact, I wrote a blog post back when I was a postdoc about coming across this.

22
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,640
You have your pictures, they come off the microscope, you go to look at them in your

23
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,320
computer and they are black.

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,280
Or sometimes you run them through your image of yourself profile or some other image in

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,600
also software and you get your output and it is black.

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,400
I know, right?

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,320
The initial fear or feeling is like panic, like what happened, what went wrong?

28
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,880
And thankfully this one is usually a really simple one.

29
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,560
So images are encoded in possibly two different ways.

30
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:07,960
There are either eight bits, so the values are between zero and 255, so 256 total values,

31
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,560
which means they're stored in two to the eight pieces of information.

32
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:23,000
Or they're 16, so they're encoded in 65,000 and change pieces of information.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,200
And so sometimes you will have noticed this when you're taking pictures on your microscope

34
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,000
and you see what your histogram values are.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,440
They might only go up as high as 250, they might go into the thousands.

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,880
The major reason why this matters specifically is this is a microscopy specific thing, or

37
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,800
at least a scientific imaging specific thing.

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:54,000
Most of the time for photography, they only use eight bits.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,280
And the reason for that is pretty simple, it's that humans can only see about 300 different

40
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,280
light levels.

41
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,400
So there's really no value in going more than eight bits because we can't see the differences.

42
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,000
To us, they literally look the same.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,440
So most image viewers are designed to support eight bit images.

44
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,480
So here are my horrible looking black images in my computer's system viewer, but if I open

45
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,080
them in Fiji, what?

46
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
Magic.

47
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,520
The information is totally there.

48
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,840
It's just there in 16 bit.

49
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,640
So usually what happens is your things that's optimized for photography shows you bits zero

50
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,800
to 255 and nothing else.

51
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,160
The background here is 300.

52
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:54,800
So if this were maybe a super, super, super dim 16 bit image, we actually would have maybe

53
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,840
been able to see it in our system viewer, but the bits between zero and 255 are nothing

54
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
here and so that is what our computer shows us.

55
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,440
So if you see that your images are black in your system viewer, don't worry about it.

56
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,480
Try them in Fiji or cell profile or something else first.

57
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,840
Hopefully it's just an image bit depth issue.

58
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,840
Great.

59
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,720
I mean, magic.

60
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,080
Looking at it like that, but makes a whole lot of sense that there's something fundamentally

61
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:34,600
different about scientific imaging and your laptop is, you know, the vast majority of

62
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,920
people who own computers are not actually working with scientific images.

63
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,920
It turns out.

64
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,920
Why?

65
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
Why don't they drop up?

66
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,400
Like everybody should have a microscope at home.

67
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Yes.

68
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:58,400
And, you know, the software that software defaults don't actually support our use.

69
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Indeed.

70
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Maybe in the future.

71
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Maybe not today.

72
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Yeah.

73
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
All right.

74
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Weird image case number two.

75
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:27,400
So ideally when we're talking about fluorescence, what we see is bright signal on a dark background.

76
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,400
But that's not actually always what we see.

77
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:42,400
I'm going to just the normalization here.

78
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Sometimes what we see.

79
00:05:51,400 --> 00:06:05,400
If I can show it correctly.

80
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Is images on a background with a lot of brightness?

81
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Let me actually do the next channel even because I think the green channel shows this even better.

82
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
Yeah.

83
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:35,400
The green channel is good here.

84
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:43,400
So let's now zoom in a tiny bit.

85
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:50,400
So I haven't really sort of pushed this out enough to make it really obviously different.

86
00:06:50,400 --> 00:07:00,400
But the reason sometimes we might see what looks like our images are in fact super bright because our background looks super bright.

87
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,400
And a lot of times people then think, oh, maybe this image is saturated.

88
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:08,400
If they see a picture that looks like this and they see all these bright spots, like maybe this image is saturated.

89
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,400
Maybe I took my values too high or microscope.

90
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,400
But the key here to sort of notice is that it's not just your signal is bright.

91
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Your background is bright.

92
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,400
And this comes down to normalization.

93
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:34,400
So as I'm hovering my cursor over here, if you look at the sort of bottom right part of cell profile or view window, these intensity numbers are super small.

94
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Even actually when I'm in the bright part of images, they're super small.

95
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Yes.

96
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Thank you.

97
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Beautiful.

98
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:48,400
And so I'm going to come back to those 300 gray levels.

99
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:59,400
When we're looking at our computer screens, we're picking essentially which 300 gray levels to show you or exactly how many gray levels sort of fit into those 300.

100
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:08,400
And so if you see that your image looks like in fact it is super bright all over, it's probably not actually that it's super bright.

101
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,400
It's probably actually that it's pretty dim.

102
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:22,400
And so the difference between the absolute dimmest pixel in your image, which is probably something close to zero and the brightest pixel in your image is not that much.

103
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,400
So your background actually looks high because it's high.

104
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
It's close in value.

105
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,400
If you divide that difference just by 300, then if these were actually thousands apart.

106
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,400
So high background actually means dim image, not bright image.

107
00:08:38,400 --> 00:09:01,400
So again, like having to do with expectations for our eyeballs pictures that you know this rescaling to make it easy for our brains to see is what is causing this artificial brightening.

108
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:13,400
So if you see something where the background is this bright, I mean, it might be that maybe you've super duper duper saturated things, but more often than not, actually what the problem is is that your images are actually too dim.

109
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Or at least they're not maybe not too dim, but they are dim.

110
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:28,400
And so before you go off and run and change or experiment settings, make sure you're changing the right one, make sure you actually understand what's going on here.

111
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:42,400
And the last one I want to talk to also comes down to that idea of normalization, which is, again, just that idea of what are the pixel values that I'm going to use to set between my zero and my dimmest one and my brightest one.

112
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,400
So so profiler has a module called overlay outlines, which allows you to overlay the outlines.

113
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,400
What?

114
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:57,400
We try to be sensible when we name these things.

115
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,400
And often people will do that on top of a color picture.

116
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:09,400
So if I want to say, okay, here what my here's what my things look like, and then like here are the objects that I got.

117
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Then this is super helpful.

118
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:20,400
You should basically always do this and save these so that you can look at them real fast from your experiment is done.

119
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Because it's really, really sad to have to go to your boss and say, actually, that thing that I just spent thousands of dollars and months of time like trying to try to optimize.

120
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Yeah, it turns out just my segmentation was bad and there was no biology actually there.

121
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
I've had to be that grad student.

122
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
It's not a fun meeting.

123
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
No, no.

124
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
Sorry, go ahead.

125
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
No, please.

126
00:10:45,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Oh, I just could say we also have we have another ask Erin dear Beth episode that we can drop the link in show notes that is a whole separate pipeline, like just for creating these overlay images, like at scale.

127
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:11,400
So no matter the size of your data set, you can make sure that you are actually looking at your segmentations.

128
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,400
So we'll we'll drop that in show notes.

129
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
Yeah.

130
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:24,400
But sometimes what happens is you go to make your overlay in CellProfiler and you get something that looks like this.

131
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,400
And people are like, Oh, what happened?

132
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Like, here's my image that I'm trying to draw outlines on.

133
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
Here's this.

134
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,400
What the f this looks terrible.

135
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,400
So why does this look terrible?

136
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:47,400
It turns out it once again comes down to this idea of normalization and trying to smush everything into, you know, sort of 300 ish gray levels.

137
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,400
So here, the images that I have are super dim.

138
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:58,400
The if we look again at that bottom bar, the values are all between like zero and zero point two.

139
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,400
But our outline that we're making is just a value of one.

140
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:09,400
It's just a, you know, nice, bright, white circle.

141
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:19,400
So when we have things between where the maximum and we can actually even just look at the image histogram here, that's probably the best thing to do.

142
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:26,400
So our image histograms here, the absolute brightest pixels here are less than zero point five zero point zero five.

143
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:32,400
So zero point zero two on a scale of zero to zero point zero five is nice and bright.

144
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,400
And so when CellProfiler does its automatic normalization, everything looks great.

145
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:47,400
If we look at the histogram values here, we have all these pixels that are one.

146
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:55,400
And so what we see is actually zero point zero two is now not halfway bright.

147
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
It is now zero percent bright.

148
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,400
And so our thing looks like crap.

149
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:14,400
The other thing that you'll sometimes see is not that just the whole thing looks black, but if I pick something like this, and I'm going to pick a different color here on purpose.

150
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:28,400
So here I have a grayscale image of these dots that then when I do my overlay now my spots all of a sudden look teal.

151
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,400
I mean, teal is lovely, but why do they look teal?

152
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,400
They look teal because teal is the opposite of blue and green.

153
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Our outlines here are super red and not super blue or green.

154
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:55,400
So red is being normalized zero to one and blue and green are being normalized something like zero to zero point zero five.

155
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:04,400
So we have what looks like and when you sort of save this and open an image shade, this will just be a gray image with a red circle.

156
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:13,400
But here it looks like blue, green with red and people then are usually very confused what's going on.

157
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Yeah.

158
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
Yeah.

159
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:25,400
So it all like, again, you have to like thinking in terms of what you see on the screen isn't necessarily what your data is.

160
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,400
It's not, you know, it is a way of representing the numbers that are there.

161
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:42,400
But, you know, different, again, you just said the difference between what Fiji shows and what CellProfiler shows like different softwares will choose to show you different ways of scaling and presenting that data to your eye so that your eye can interpret it.

162
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,400
Even if the underlying numbers are completely the same.

163
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Yeah, beautifully put.

164
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:53,400
So just to sort of let you know how do you deal with this.

165
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,400
Oh yeah, so that's nice.

166
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Yeah.

167
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,400
So there are these adjust contrast things and CellProfiler.

168
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:09,400
So if it is showing you in raw and you want to look at normalized or you want to change the brightness, I sort of did this already and sort of didn't really explain to you what I was doing.

169
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,400
It's actually even other ways to normalize it, which are helpful sometimes your images are really, really dim.

170
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,400
You can change any of these one at a time sort of on the fly.

171
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:30,400
If you want your output images to be visible in your net computer's viewer, you probably want to sort of make them be eight rather than 16 bit.

172
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:48,400
So for this problem of making these overlays, in fact, the color version of it is actually so common that in the greater color module, we actually have a setting here that we've added that is rescale intensity yes or no.

173
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:57,400
So what that allows you to do is you can have your things and you can just say, okay, but this is going to be for visualization.

174
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:06,400
Let's just sort of make it rescaled. And so now instead of my things looking like they're being drawn on top of nothingness it looks like they're being drawn on top of the image.

175
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:20,400
It's just lovely and totally representative of a thing we can, you know, that you'll hear us say in many of our podcast episodes right where like, if it's for visualization purposes, anything goes.

176
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:27,400
If you're just trying to like see what's happening in your data scale the heck out of it do math on it like whatever you want.

177
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:40,400
So remember, like that is for things you're looking at by eye, and don't then keep those transformations and make quantitative measurements on them.

178
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:48,400
Yes, absolutely. Anything else you can think of in terms of what are what are the weirdest looking images you've seen.

179
00:16:48,400 --> 00:17:03,400
Weird images I think I, you know, have encountered more than once the like, hey, what happened to my image like I can't it's weird and grainy looking or it's blobby, and it wasn't before.

180
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:23,400
That can definitely happen if you think about any time an image is being saved, you know, opened up and saved again, and somebody has been non intentional about what they have saved it out as we can without deep diving into file formats because

181
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:40,400
that's a whole other tangent I'm not sure I want to talk about right now like there are, you know, file formats that preserve all of your data, and then there are file formats that are meant for that that don't preserve as much data but are optimized for other things

182
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:47,400
like, you know, making your file as small as possible and so if you've accidentally saved in that kind of format, you can lose data.

183
00:17:47,400 --> 00:18:03,400
And if this happens repeatedly, like it can have you know you can lose some every time and so thinking about like, is this actually my raw image that came off my microscope or is this something that has been sent to me in an email and therefore

184
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:14,400
I have been compressed in the email and then I try and download it in email and so and you know anything, any sort of for screenshots, it's screenshot.

185
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Oh gosh screenshots for sure.

186
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:23,400
We end up with that, especially, especially like helping people on the forum.

187
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Because again, like sometimes that's perfectly appropriate if you have, you know, it's a screenshot of like, hey, this is what I'm seeing.

188
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:50,400
Like, can somebody explain what what things I might change to, you know, better segment these blobs, but when it comes down to like, hey, please suggest actual parameters in a real pipeline, then we need the og data, like, we can't do, you know, we can give you vibes, based on anything

189
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,400
that we want to do.

190
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:59,400
But like, if it's, you know, get quantitation needs to be actual og files. So,

191
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,400
I think we're going to talk about the forum in a future episode aren't we.

192
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
I think we are.

193
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
Yeah.

194
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,400
So we should make sure to mention that when we do.

195
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Absolutely.

196
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,400
All right. Thank you so much. I had a great time hanging out with you.

197
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
Thanks, Beth.

198
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
I'm just thinking that we're not so pretty.

199
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,400
I know. Just gonna say I had more fun looking at ugly images than I thought I would. So thanks for that.

200
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Awesome. See you later.

201
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
Talk to you later.
