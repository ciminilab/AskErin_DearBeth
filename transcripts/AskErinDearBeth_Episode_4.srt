1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey Beth!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:18,200
Hey Erin! Lovely to see you as always.

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,800
You too!

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,120
Welcome everyone to another episode of Ask Erin, Dear Beth, where we talk through your

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,280
common image analysis problems and try to teach you how we do stuff and how we make our own

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:35,280
lives easier and hopefully make your lives easier as well.

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,280
Welcome to the docket for today!

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,480
Yeah, so today we're going to take a look at some images that are in proprietary file

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,480
formats.

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,400
So some microscopes just give you things like a TIP file or even a JPEG files that you're

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,960
used to seeing, files that maybe come off the digital camera that you have or your phone's

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,960
camera.

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,840
Some microscopes don't do that.

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,240
Some microscopes make these proprietary file formats that are specific to that microscope.

15
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,920
And they can be a little bit scary if you don't know how to handle them.

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,640
So we're going to actually look at doing two different things with these file formats today.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,320
One of them is putting them in image.js and actually just turning them into TIFs that

18
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,720
are then more portable and easier to move around.

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,680
And the other one is actually using the same library that image.js uses a library called

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,480
Bioformats to read those directly into CellProfiler and then you can skip that intermediate

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,320
step where you're making copies of the data.

22
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
Nice.

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,800
All right.

24
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,800
Shall we do it?

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Let's do it.

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,520
All right.

27
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,440
So here I have two files.

28
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,240
These are proprietary files that are called dot flex that have come off a microscope.

29
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,800
And I got this data from the IDR.

30
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,320
If you check out our episode on downloading data from the IDR, these are the data that

31
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,400
we downloaded.

32
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,600
And we love using public data wherever we can because it's great.

33
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,560
People have said that they want to share it and it's usually also really good, really

34
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,440
clean data.

35
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,960
People tend not to share their absolute ugliest data.

36
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,040
Maybe they should.

37
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,760
Nobody wants to show off their dirty laundry.

38
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,280
So here we have two wells.

39
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:21,040
So this is well H10 and this is well J9 from one particular plate of data.

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,440
And the reason I'm showing first that opening this in image.js is because that is always

41
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
what I do when I get new data.

42
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,040
I don't know about you, Erin, but the very first thing I do when I get new data is I

43
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,400
just go to Image.js because Image.js is wonderful.

44
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
It is lovely.

45
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,720
It is so great.

46
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,120
And I never really want to do anything else.

47
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,120
Yeah.

48
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,440
I mean, I think that is so many good principles there.

49
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,760
First thing you do when you get any data is look at it.

50
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,960
We are biologists at heart and we want to see the pictures first.

51
00:02:53,960 --> 00:03:02,480
And then yeah, Image.js is a very usable tool for looking at images.

52
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,720
So here we are looking at images.

53
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,080
So we can see some of the metadata which Image.js has so helpfully loaded for us.

54
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,200
And it says that we have four channels here and 20 time points.

55
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,520
I also have some like random metadata has been added here by the microscope manufacturer.

56
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,560
And I was surprised.

57
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,280
I kind of thought that this was going to then change into field number, whatever, because

58
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,960
these are clearly not actually different time points.

59
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:34,080
These are clearly different sites in the world, but sometimes metadata reading is not perfect.

60
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
Yeah.

61
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:43,320
So even one of the challenges of proprietary file format, I mean of any file format that

62
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:51,600
has metadata saved into it, like here Bioformats is doing its very best to parse the metadata.

63
00:03:51,600 --> 00:04:00,040
But as biologists with some level of intuition, again, like we can't rely strictly on what

64
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,440
the computer can do for us.

65
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,440
It's doing its best.

66
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,440
It tried.

67
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,280
It found 28 different things.

68
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,960
But we have a level of intuition here where we can say, well, actually, I can look at those

69
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,720
and tell you that those, you know, each image is too disparate from the one next to it.

70
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,560
Those are clearly not the same cells imaged over time.

71
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,200
Those are clearly different, you know, images of different cells.

72
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,200
And so maybe that doesn't actually matter for your experiment.

73
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,920
Like whatever, you know, whatever it's parsing, as long as it says there's 28 different things

74
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,280
you can just proceed with there.

75
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,560
But sometimes it does matter, you know, how it's parsing, parsing different bits of metadata.

76
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,560
So that's just something to keep in mind, to like to double check it and change it if

77
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
you need to.

78
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,520
And if you don't, don't worry about it, but a good thing just to keep in mind.

79
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,520
And this is pretty common.

80
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,640
A lot of programs for doing microscopy image analysis assume that there are five dimensions

81
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,840
XYZ channel and time.

82
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,240
They don't really take into account multiple fields of view, because it's not really something

83
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,000
you would usually look at in a single file, except for that those are easier to port around.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,920
And so this is a really common mistake in that there was only one dimension left.

85
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,080
And so it used it for that.

86
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,000
So here I've opened up my channels tool.

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,560
These are also the things that I always do when I have new data is I go to image, color,

88
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,800
I do the channels tool.

89
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,480
And then I also go to image, adjust brightness contrast.

90
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,800
And with those two windows open, you can do just about anything.

91
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,920
So I'm going to change this from grayscale to composite max so I can see all of my channels

92
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,480
out once.

93
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,680
And because it's going to automatically min max the data, I'm going to then also just

94
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,360
go through and hit this auto button here, you know, it's blowing out some of the channels,

95
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,360
but I'm just trying to really get a sense of what's going on in this data.

96
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,880
And so we clearly have a cytoskeletal marker here in this fourth channel.

97
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,280
This first channel is some sort of a nuclear marker.

98
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,280
And we could go back and we could look at the metadata that the people have uploaded

99
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,640
in order to sort of, if we needed to know more specifically than that, but for our purposes

100
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,800
here, we're just kind of exploring and seeing what's going on.

101
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,840
Some sort of cytosolic marker.

102
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,360
And some marker that I'm not quite sure what it is.

103
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,280
It's really bright here.

104
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,280
It's really bright here.

105
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,600
It's really bright here in some of these speckly places.

106
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,560
So those could be debris or those could be mitosis that could be like some sort of a

107
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,720
mitotic marker.

108
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,160
And this is from the same plate.

109
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,200
So it should hopefully have all the same channels, but we can convince ourselves that what's

110
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,160
how similar the data is or is not going to be when we then actually start trying to do

111
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,280
our analysis again by just doing the same thing.

112
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,360
And we could even transfer the settings if we wanted across from one to the other.

113
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,600
But here again, we're just going for vibes.

114
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Yeah.

115
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,440
And I think an important thing to point out here is we're not changing the data, the underlying

116
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,440
data itself.

117
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,440
Super important point.

118
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,400
What we're doing is just changing how it is being shown to our eyes.

119
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,640
So, you know, our eyes can see now clearly the patterns that are happening in these cells,

120
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:36,640
but the underlying data has not been changed by adjusting this right here.

121
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,640
Yeah, absolutely.

122
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,160
I can change it if I want.

123
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,280
If I hit this apply button, it will apply it, but it will warn me before I do that.

124
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,920
But I don't want to do that because again, we're really just trying to get a sense of

125
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,600
our data here.

126
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,200
So there's nothing wrong with having data in this format, but if for whatever reason,

127
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,480
I was dealing with something downstream where I didn't want the data in this format either

128
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,600
because I don't want it in the dot flex proprietary format, which requires a special reader, imagery

129
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,640
and CellProfiler, I both use bio formats, which is an open source thing for doing reading.

130
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,240
But for whatever reason, you didn't want to deal with that.

131
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,000
Or if just you wanted to not have the data broken one thing per well, maybe you just

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,360
want to send one site of images.

133
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,280
And so you don't actually want that big of a data.

134
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,320
You just want everything by itself.

135
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:38,400
What you can actually do is go to file, save as image sequence.

136
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:44,440
And that will actually let you then say, all right, I need I want a two digit number or

137
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,120
a three digit number here, but you could change the number of digits for like channel time

138
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,640
point should make everything be at least two digits.

139
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,880
Because you know, for one thing I have 28.

140
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,520
So if I try to make that one digit, I expect Fiji will yell at me, but I usually try not

141
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,040
to make Fiji mad if I can avoid it.

142
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,520
And so that is just going to then very quickly fill that folder up.

143
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,120
And so we have our original image, which is this string here that indicates that we're

144
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
in well Jane nine.

145
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,360
We have time point zero zero one and we have channel zero zero one and so on and so forth.

146
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,440
So I'm just going to quickly do the same thing.

147
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,120
It's not export it's save as.

148
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:35,120
And I'm going to put my data in the right place because staying organized is nice.

149
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,120
Look at that.

150
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,120
Yeah.

151
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:48,760
So, Beth, I before we leave Fiji, I've got one question when you very first like opened

152
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:55,480
up those images, you drag and you just dragged and dropped them to the toolbar and something

153
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,520
popped up when you did that.

154
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,520
Yeah.

155
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,400
Great thing that I completely breezed over.

156
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,560
So this is the bioformat loader.

157
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:09,200
So that's actually how you know that this is using bioformats to load that data.

158
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:15,120
And again, bioformats fantastic open source project, you know, that is adds incredible

159
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,080
value to the community.

160
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,520
And it gives you a lot of different options.

161
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,640
If you want, you could say that you only want you want each thing with its own channel

162
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
or its own time point.

163
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:29,400
So if I wanted all of those files individual, I wanted like each thing I could do that.

164
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:36,080
I can also ask it to show me some of the metadata, Erin's favorite thing metadata.

165
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,760
If there were ROI's that had been saved off of your microscope or when you saved the data

166
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,960
last, you could open those.

167
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,440
So a lot of things you can do with the bioformats loader.

168
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,920
But that is showing you that it's not just sort of opening a random image, it's opening

169
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,920
an image using bioformats and Fiji is really smart about it will usually try to open things

170
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,440
with a regular loader.

171
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,800
And then if it can't, it'll ask bioformats like, Hey, can you handle this data?

172
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,960
And bioformats can handle hundreds of different kinds of file formats.

173
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
It's so great.

174
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
Awesome.

175
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,680
So you didn't, when you opened up these images, you didn't change anything away from default.

176
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,680
Nope.

177
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,400
I just left everything exactly the same.

178
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,320
You write that like I could have, I could have since I've eventually put everything

179
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,200
into composite, I could have moved everything into composite, or I could have sort of changed

180
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,520
some things about the order or again, split out the channels and things.

181
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:28,200
But it's nice to just keep one file, one sort of window per well, and then be able to sort

182
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
of scroll back and forth.

183
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,200
Awesome.

184
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Great.

185
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,200
Thank you for pointing that out that I totally missed that.

186
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
Cool.

187
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,280
So what happens when you want to put this data into CellProfiler?

188
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,680
So sub profiler, like I said, also uses bioformats.

189
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,320
So it can actually open those dot flex files.

190
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,600
And it's pretty simple, but because it's often a little bit easier to do it with individual

191
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,200
files, at least in sort of walking you through how CellProfiler it's open data, I'm going

192
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:07,240
to actually start from these individual files that we've made.

193
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,320
So here I've dragged and dropped these in.

194
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,200
We now have all of our individual things.

195
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,120
I can click on each one.

196
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:21,240
And there's our channel one, our nuclei, channel two, our sort of marker that we said was kind

197
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,320
of cytosolic, but we weren't quite sure.

198
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,000
This is the one we said might be mitotic, and this is the one that we said was definitely

199
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,040
cytoskeletal.

200
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:39,120
So if I wanted to say load just the nuclear and the cytoskeletal ones just so that I

201
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,760
could get a quick sense of like I want to identify cells, this is what I would do.

202
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,480
I've loaded all of my data.

203
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,360
I know the way that it's telling the difference between the different channels.

204
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,160
It's with the C thing that we told image J to make.

205
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,800
So if I go to my names and types module, all I need to do in order to tell names and types

206
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:07,280
what my different channels are is I can say if a file has C001 in it, it's a DNA image.

207
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,040
So I change this from all images to images matching rules because we have multiple kinds

208
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,640
of images here.

209
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:26,160
And then I can say add another image and I can say if it has C004 in it that this is

210
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,920
our cytoskeletal.

211
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,520
If I hit update, what will hopefully happen here is I will now see we had 28 sites per

212
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,720
well and we did two wells.

213
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,600
So I will hopefully get a message from CellProfiler here that is giving me 56 image sets.

214
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
Let's find out.

215
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,200
56 image sets.

216
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,000
So I've only loaded those two channels here.

217
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,240
If I wanted to load more channels, I could just keep hitting add more images and add

218
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,280
in our other images.

219
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,640
But all I had to do was figure out what is the thing that makes that channel unique.

220
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,000
And so allow that to be a moment where we plug for the importance of having a consistent

221
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,280
naming structure for your data.

222
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,120
So if you have a naming structure, doing a step like this where you say, hey CellProfiler,

223
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,560
the way you can tell which images are my DNA marker and which are my cytoskeletal is just

224
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,760
by looking for this in the file name, your life will get a lot simpler.

225
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,960
If your files all are named slightly differently, you're going to have a much harder time.

226
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Yeah.

227
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,960
Yeah.

228
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:37,480
And this is something that we, like, we help teach collaborators sort of all the time.

229
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:43,840
I think, especially as we are in the more computational realm, I think biologists who

230
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:49,640
don't have computational training and who are used to perhaps just opening up every

231
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,320
picture and looking by eye and writing down notes.

232
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:59,080
Even if you're in the early stages of data exploration, data generation, it doesn't matter

233
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
so much.

234
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,000
And so it's not something that you're used to thinking about.

235
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:12,200
But as you move into the realm of computation, the realm of reproducible analyses, that is

236
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,040
sort of a frame shift is required in thinking about it.

237
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,280
We're like, oh, actually, when I've got handfuls of images and I'm doing stuff by hand, it

238
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,280
doesn't really matter.

239
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:28,440
But when you start to scale and when you start to do things where a computer is parsing things

240
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,880
instead of you going and clicking on your files, then it really does actually start

241
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,360
to matter a lot.

242
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,760
And this is something that we help teach collaborators moving into this space all the time.

243
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:46,040
And in the defense of biologists, including both you and me, Erin, this is not something

244
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,920
that was generally, I didn't learn, you know, get to grad school day one, like file naming

245
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,920
structures.

246
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,920
I wish.

247
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,920
I wish that was what had happened.

248
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,960
But totally it was not what happened.

249
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,840
I mean, I'm sure that when I first got trained at the microscope, they were like, you should

250
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,600
have consistent file naming, but I didn't understand why it mattered.

251
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,560
And once you start doing this, then you understand why it mattered.

252
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,120
And then you wish you'd started doing it a year or two before.

253
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,120
Absolutely.

254
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,120
Absolutely.

255
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,600
No, I mean, you know, as Beth said, like she and I are both wet lab biology trained before

256
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,720
moving into this space.

257
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,160
So these are all lessons that we learned the hard way.

258
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,360
We would like you to learn the easy way.

259
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Yeah.

260
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,400
All right.

261
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,160
So what if I hadn't split these things apart?

262
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,080
What if I had kept them all together?

263
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,680
I'm going to clear file list, such a useful thing in CellProfiler.

264
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,760
And instead, I'm going to drag in these files.

265
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:45,800
I'm now going to have to do one extra step that I completely skipped when I was doing

266
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,080
everything being an individual file, which is I'm going to have to extract metadata.

267
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,640
Now, this is one of the modules in CellProfiler that people find the scariest and I don't blame

268
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,480
them because when it first comes up, it shows you all of this horrible regular expression

269
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,920
stuff, which is about trying to get information from the file name.

270
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,640
So if, especially if you use a high content microscope, where you're generating scans

271
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,880
of a plate, you will, you might have something where things like the well position are encoded

272
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
in your file name.

273
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,400
That's in fact, exactly what we have here.

274
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,760
But if you're not used to looking at computers, this is horrifying.

275
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,520
And in fact, probably the thing you will use more often, certainly if you have proprietary

276
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,480
file formats is this extract from image file headers.

277
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,760
So what this is saying is, hey, we know that there's a whole bunch of files in here.

278
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,120
In fact, we know from opening these in Fiji, there's 112 files in each file.

279
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,560
So probably could you just go look at that and, you know, figure that out for me.

280
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,680
So I hit the extract button.

281
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,720
And I hit update and hurray.

282
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,920
So profiler has in fact found it for me.

283
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:56,360
So it's showing here that my four channels, I have now learned something about when

284
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,480
this experiment was done.

285
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,320
There are apparently three cameras on this microscope.

286
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,000
And for the first exposure, they used cameras one and three.

287
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,520
And the second and third, they used camera two.

288
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,320
That's pretty cool.

289
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,440
And we have lots of information that was encoded in the metadata.

290
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,320
So profiler doesn't pull every piece of metadata, but it pulls a bunch of them.

291
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,560
And we have our same well information that we had over an image.

292
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:17,880
Shay.

293
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,320
And we have our four channels and our 20 time points.

294
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,040
So we got the exact same answer either way, which is what we hope.

295
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,920
Because we're using the same software under the hood.

296
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,320
So that's all well and good.

297
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,080
But so profiler before was using the file names to sort of tell the difference

298
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,800
between the channels.

299
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,760
So we're going to have to do something different here.

300
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,040
So the things that are different between the channels, if we just look at what

301
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,600
metadata we have, are this C and this channel name.

302
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,760
C goes zero one, two, three.

303
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,040
So profiler is written in Python, which is what's called a zero counted language.

304
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,200
It doesn't count one, two, three, four.

305
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,800
It counts zero, one, two, three.

306
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,840
I'm sure there's a reason I don't know what it is, but that's how they decided to do it.

307
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,640
So I could use this zero, one, two, three, or I could use these different channel names.

308
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,880
I know me.

309
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,560
I will have a harder time remembering these.

310
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,240
So I'm going to use this C parameter instead.

311
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,720
But I could have used the other one if this had been named something like

312
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,440
nuclei and cytoskeleton.

313
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,920
It would have been easy for me to remember.

314
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,280
I could do that too.

315
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,560
So all I need to do when I go over to the names and types modules now, it's not based on file anymore.

316
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,440
It's based on metadata.

317
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:40,400
So I just click that file that drop down next to file and I click metadata.

318
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,320
And it actually defaults to asking, is it C that you want to use?

319
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,240
Because that is the thing that people most commonly want to use for channel.

320
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,640
And I'm going to tell it I want zero, which is our previous one.

321
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,320
And instead of four here, I'm going to have to change it to three, because again,

322
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,920
we're changing counting schemes.

323
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,560
But now again, hopefully I hit update and I continue to have 56.

324
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,960
We still do.

325
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,960
And so we've now taught cell par filer in a couple of different ways,

326
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,640
how to open these proprietary file formats with different metadata structures.

327
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,720
We've explored them with ImageShay.

328
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,120
And now we would be ready to actually build our pipeline and do a real experiment.

329
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,440
Awesome.

330
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,400
Look at that.

331
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,560
Good to go.

332
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,080
It felt a little scary at first, but once you kind of understand like

333
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,040
CellProfilers internal logic, we got through it.

334
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,120
It's not so bad.

335
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,880
Definitely not so bad.

336
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,760
And I love the thing about, you know, just made me think here where you're saying like,

337
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,520
oh, we've got a, you know, a default of C matching, like a sort of a big picture thing

338
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:54,760
about CellProfiler is, you know, it is biologists, us biologists that are heavily

339
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,520
involved in the creation and maintenance and, you know, updating of CellProfiler.

340
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:05,680
And so all of these defaults that you find within CellProfiler all over the place

341
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:11,720
are actually considered, you know, we have very opinionated biologists in our team,

342
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,960
you know, and, and we weigh in very much.

343
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,240
I'm like, Hey, actually, this is what I, you know, this is what I think is the most

344
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,640
common. This is what I'm encountering all the time.

345
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,080
This is so my collaborators are encountering all the time.

346
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:32,960
And so, you know, the default things throughout CellProfiler are actually, you know, even

347
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,400
if they're not what you want necessarily, they're often pretty informative about sort

348
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,760
of a way of thinking about any given thing that like this is the most common use case

349
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,200
for whatever you're filling in that has a default.

350
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,160
In defense of CellProfiler.

351
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,560
In defense of opinionated biologists.

352
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,840
I think that's that's we certainly defend and support those wherever we can.

353
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,200
Absolutely.

354
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,480
All right. Well, thank you so much for joining us.

355
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,280
Hope this helped.

356
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,200
See you next time.

357
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,520
Bye.
