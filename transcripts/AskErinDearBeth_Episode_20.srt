00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey Erin!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello Beth!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:18,400
Good to see ya!

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,400
Always a pleasure.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,720
Always enjoy podcast day.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,200
I wanted to just quickly talk today about a resource that was made by bioimaging North

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,520
America as well as our team called the Bioimaging Guide that I think and hope is super helpful

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,200
for helping people realize what they don't know they don't know about bioimage analysis.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,200
Yeah, that's a good one.

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,200
And bioimaging in general.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,200
Yeah.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Yeah.

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,800
So obviously we'll put the links for this in the show notes but this is the Bioimaging

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,300
Guide.

15
00:00:52,300 --> 00:01:01,440
So this is actually the companion to a paper that a whole bunch of fantastic people led

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,720
by a couple of former postdocs in the imaging platform, Rebecca and Barbara, but a ton of

17
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:15,400
names you've probably seen before, great folks who put this together.

18
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,240
Here's the major take home if you learn nothing else.

19
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,840
A lot of people spend a lot of time going back and forth between sample preparation

20
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,760
and image acquisition and they optimize these two things back and forth a lot.

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,560
And then once they're happy with this, they start thinking about image analysis and then

22
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,080
once they're happy with this, they start thinking about data interpretation.

23
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,560
And that actually makes your life a lot harder than it needs to be.

24
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,840
If you do image analysis as soon as you can, as soon as your images seem kind of reasonable,

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,840
you might actually pick up on artifacts or things that you could fix at the sample preparation

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,920
or the image acquisition stage that you didn't know were going to be a problem until you

27
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,680
started trying to put your analysis together or until you started looking at your thinking

28
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,120
about what are the statistics I'm going to present.

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,320
So the sooner you put this whole cycle together and the more feedback you let there be between

30
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,360
the steps, the better your experiment is going to go and the more likely that you're going

31
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,960
to get data that helps you at the end.

32
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,080
Yeah, absolutely.

33
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:29,640
And I think lots of people who are trained as wet lab biologists doing the sample prep

34
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,400
and the image acquisition is the thing that is most comfortable to them.

35
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,920
I think don't think about the image analysis and data interpretation part of also having

36
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,880
that same sort of iterative cycle.

37
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,560
We will do assay development.

38
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,480
We will start with a rough pipeline and then we will refine it and then we will make sure

39
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,680
it's giving the outputs that we can use to do the biological statistics that we want

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,240
to do.

41
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:06,120
But that is a place that receives just as much iteration as the image acquisition and

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
sample prep.

43
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,200
And so thinking sort of in that, expanding your framework of thought to include image

44
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,040
analysis is not just, okay, I've done all of the images.

45
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:24,120
Now we go make this one holy grail perfect pipeline to extract data.

46
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,120
That's not how it works.

47
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,120
Yeah.

48
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,880
And if it is how it works, then you might miss out on the chance to say, oh, if I'd

49
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,680
actually switched from wide field to confocal, I could have done my analysis really easily,

50
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,400
but now my analysis is super hard.

51
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,280
You can actually do less image analysis by doing image analysis earlier often.

52
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,280
Yeah.

53
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,000
Because you can fix things at the sample prep and the image acquisition stage.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,960
So I certainly hope you read this paper.

55
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,880
It was the hard work of a lot of people, but so what we wanted to do was to provide a high

56
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:07,080
level overview of here are all of the sort of major things to think about ahead of time

57
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,600
because often part of the reason that people sort of don't do these steps in order is not

58
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,800
because they're malicious.

59
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,400
It's because first they get taught to do this because this happens first and then they get

60
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,200
taught to do this and then they get taught to do this.

61
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,680
And so they weren't even, they didn't even know this was a thing while they were doing

62
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,680
this.

63
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,200
Like it's not that they're trying to do bad science.

64
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,320
They're not doing bad science.

65
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,440
They just don't know what they don't know.

66
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,440
Yeah, absolutely.

67
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,240
I think this also comes into play with our, like often a lot of what we do, I mean, we

68
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,320
are strictly image analysts.

69
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,200
We are not doing any wet lab prep.

70
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,040
So we have lots of collaborators that are doing just the sample prep and image acquisition.

71
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
And that's fine.

72
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,400
You know, if that, you know, that's their, you know, having separate skill sets and bringing

73
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,000
in collaborators is amazing and super important part of science.

74
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,280
But also everybody is happier and more successful when there is at least constant communication.

75
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,840
So if you're not doing the image analysis yourself, if you don't want, you know, if

76
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,000
you don't have the time and space and opportunity to develop all of those skills on your own,

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,600
there should at the very least be a constant conversation between, you know, experts in

78
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,720
any one arm of their, you know, sometimes we even then get involved with experts in statistics

79
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:32,400
because we have some basic knowledge of statistics from what we do, but we're not experts in it.

80
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,480
And so, you know, likely you are more comfortable in one of these corners than the other.

81
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:44,440
And so having lots of communication from the beginning, lots of planning from the beginning

82
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,960
with the collaborator that is more expert in any one given area will also make this

83
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,800
all so much better, even if you're not doing it all yourself.

84
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah.

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,360
I'm sure there's someone out there who's incredibly comfortable in all four, but there's probably

86
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,440
like one person.

87
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:58,960
Yeah.

88
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,760
Like most people, it's like one, maybe two.

89
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:01,680
Yeah.

90
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,280
So anyway, this is a awesome paper.

91
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,000
Please do read it.

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,040
It's got sort of things of like how you might think through some stuff.

93
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,000
It's got a glossary.

94
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,120
And it has a list of resources.

95
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,760
And the major thing that we worried about, because we've written papers like this before,

96
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,400
is the second that you make a list of resources.

97
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,120
Somebody publishes a new great resource and now your resources are out of date.

98
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,640
The other thing that we weren't incredibly excited about is a paper has to have a certain

99
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,760
scholarly tone to it.

100
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,720
And sometimes we're more interested in a conversational friendly tone instead.

101
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,200
You know, there's this place for all of these things.

102
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,200
And so while we were writing the paper, we said, we don't want to just write a paper.

103
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,000
We want there to also be a website version of this, a website version where we can be

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,320
a little more conversational.

105
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,320
We can have a few more discussions and we can keep it up to date and keep adding new

106
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,520
things that we like.

107
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,360
And so this is bioimagingguide.org.

108
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,800
It's the companion website to this paper.

109
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,880
And what it isn't is an exhaustive list of all resources.

110
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:29,160
What it isn't is, you know, a three semester, you know, course sequence on here's how you

111
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,400
learn to do all of these things because people have already done great work.

112
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,560
It's a lot of great work out there.

113
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,920
But what we wanted to do is in the same thing as the paper, just give you a high level list

114
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,960
of like, here's what's out there here, the major things you probably want to know about.

115
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,400
And then give you a way to learn it.

116
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,000
And so here again is that same figure.

117
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,960
But so each section sort of starts with an introduction.

118
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,200
Why is this thing important?

119
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,480
What does this contribute?

120
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,800
And it's based around the same four quadrants that were in that figure.

121
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,720
And each section ends with resources for learning more.

122
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,520
Those resources might be papers.

123
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,960
They might be websites.

124
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,680
They might be textbooks.

125
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,080
They might be videos.

126
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:28,080
And so what we've really tried to do here is say, here's the overall basic idea.

127
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,000
These are the major things you should think about.

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,320
And here are experts you can go talk to.

129
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,560
Sometimes these are the links to sort of societies.

130
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,880
You can check out our podcast episode on some of the different societies we like

131
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,880
and the conferences that they have where you can go and learn more.

132
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,560
Because my team is an image analysis team, we've put a lot of time into the image analysis

133
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,360
part of the book.

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,040
And this is one of my favorite parts.

135
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,840
And so it has things like, what is this thing?

136
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,600
How do I measure it?

137
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,080
Where can things go wrong?

138
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,880
Where can I learn more about this?

139
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,400
And we try wherever we can to sort of say, oh yeah, like, here's an analogy.

140
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,000
You know, here's something to just sort of make this a little bit easier.

141
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,800
And so if you try to read a paper like that and, you know, it's just not getting through,

142
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,440
we hope this guide will be a sort of more intuitive and nice way.

143
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:43,440
And if you think there's something missing, we have a Google form where you can suggest

144
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,600
and say like, hey, you know what's not in here that I think would be really helpful.

145
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,800
Like either here's a particular paper I think is cool that you should add or, you know,

146
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,160
you haven't covered this.

147
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,400
And that's really confusing to me.

148
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,560
We can't promise we'll do it immediately.

149
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,840
We absolutely welcome you to actually just write stuff for the book.

150
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,440
Anyone can write for the book.

151
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,240
But you absolutely can also just say like, I really feel like this is missing.

152
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,360
I don't know it well enough to teach it, but I want to learn it.

153
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,400
And if the reason that you're having difficulty figuring out some of this stuff

154
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,800
is because maybe English isn't your first language,

155
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,440
which for the majority of the people in the world it is not.

156
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,720
We've worked with some great scientists in doing this.

157
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,880
In different parts of who are from different parts of the world originally,

158
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,200
and some of them still to start translating the guide into other languages.

159
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,320
So here is the bio-imaging guide in Spanish.

160
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,200
Right now, besides English, it's available in Spanish, Portuguese and Czech.

161
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,640
We are happy to work with folks.

162
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,880
If you think this is super cool and you want to help us correct AI translations

163
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,520
into good actual translations, we're totally happy to work with you to get this book

164
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,880
in whatever language you want it to be.

165
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,440
Just email me.

166
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,840
There's a link on the page.

167
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:17,520
But if nothing else, what I hope you take away from this episode is

168
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,480
it's really critical to help to come up with these sort of plans

169
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,880
and understand the whole experiment before you finish some of the parts

170
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,120
and realize that now you might actually need to redo them.

171
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,720
But you don't need to know everything right away.

172
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,160
If you just get a sense of what you don't know and who to talk to,

173
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,040
then there are resources out there to help you find the right person to talk to

174
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,200
and they can help you do the best experiment possible.

175
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,880
Absolutely.

176
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:57,200
Yeah, the you don't know what you don't know is such a hard thing to overcome in any field,

177
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,160
in any area.

178
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:05,200
And so it's so great to have a resource here built around that question of just letting

179
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,800
you understand better.

180
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:13,200
What don't you already know that you might need or want to become expert in or find a friend

181
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,240
who is expert in?

182
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,040
Awesome.

183
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,920
Thanks for hanging out.

184
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,880
I hope that was useful.

185
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,920
We hope you like the book.

186
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,720
We hope you give us more stuff that you want to learn in it.

187
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,240
And thanks for hanging out.

188
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,360
Thank you.
