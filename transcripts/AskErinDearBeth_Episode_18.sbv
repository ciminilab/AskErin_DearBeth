Hello Beth!

0:00:16.000,0:00:17.000
Erin, hi!

0:00:17.000,0:00:18.000
Hello!

0:00:18.000,0:00:25.120
Okay, so this is kind of a silly intro to record because this podcast episode, you and

0:00:25.120,0:00:32.640
I were at SBI2 conference and did sort of, you know, woman on the street interviews with

0:00:32.640,0:00:39.520
folks around the conference and then of course failed to actually get video evidence of the

0:00:39.520,0:00:42.720
two of us being in the same place at the same time.

0:00:42.720,0:00:44.040
Were we though?

0:00:44.040,0:00:47.760
I mean, has anyone ever seen the two of us together at the same time?

0:00:47.760,0:00:49.600
I don't know, I don't know.

0:00:49.600,0:00:57.440
I can neither confirm nor deny these rumors, but what I can say is this is a fun and silly

0:00:57.440,0:01:04.080
episode where we ask a couple hard-hitting questions of some of our friends and colleagues

0:01:04.080,0:01:08.240
that we ran into at SBI2 conference 2025.

0:01:08.240,0:01:12.600
And here we're going to talk about conferences in another episode.

0:01:12.600,0:01:13.600
We will, yes.

0:01:13.600,0:01:18.480
We will actually talk about, you know, conferences, you know, actual conversation, but this one's

0:01:18.480,0:01:22.200
just fun and silly, so enjoy!

0:01:22.200,0:01:23.200
Enjoy!

0:01:23.200,0:01:28.000
We have a woman on the street episode of Ask Erin Dear Beth.

0:01:28.000,0:01:29.000
Hello!

0:01:29.000,0:01:31.480
Introduce yourself, please, dear sir.

0:01:31.480,0:01:33.200
Mike Lippincott, nice to meet you.

0:01:33.200,0:01:34.200
You too!

0:01:34.200,0:01:36.800
Tell us, what is your favorite CellProfiler feature?

0:01:36.800,0:01:39.720
It would have to be texture features.

0:01:39.720,0:01:42.080
Tell me more, what do you like about texture features?

0:01:42.080,0:01:51.600
Well, primarily that they were derived from old military, like, information metrics on

0:01:51.600,0:01:57.000
where beaches, railroads, munitions stores and such, and we've adapted them for the image-based

0:01:57.000,0:01:58.000
profiling community.

0:01:58.000,0:01:59.000
I love it.

0:01:59.000,0:02:00.000
A little bit of history here.

0:02:00.000,0:02:01.000
Thanks for your input.

0:02:01.000,0:02:02.000
Hi!

0:02:02.000,0:02:03.000
Hi!

0:02:03.000,0:02:06.000
Beth Cimini here with Erin Dearbeth.

0:02:06.000,0:02:07.520
Alright, Erin, big question.

0:02:07.520,0:02:09.160
What's your favorite CellProfiler feature?

0:02:09.160,0:02:14.600
My favorite feature is CellProfiler Analyst, because a very lovely colleague of mine, David

0:02:14.600,0:02:16.400
Sterling, did a lot of great work on it.

0:02:16.400,0:02:17.400
Thank you so much!

0:02:17.400,0:02:18.400
Of course, thank you!

0:02:18.400,0:02:19.400
Hello!

0:02:19.400,0:02:20.400
Hey there!

0:02:20.400,0:02:22.720
We've got a question for you.

0:02:22.720,0:02:23.720
Introduce yourself, dear sir.

0:02:23.720,0:02:25.760
Okay, hey, I'm John.

0:02:25.760,0:02:29.800
Hello, and what is your favorite CellProfiler feature?

0:02:29.800,0:02:31.880
It's area shape.

0:02:31.880,0:02:36.000
Area? Yeah. Area shape. Alright, tell us more about that. What do you like about...

0:02:37.000,0:02:39.000
No, it's not the area.

0:02:41.000,0:02:43.000
It's cell area.

0:02:43.000,0:02:46.000
Cell area. Okay, tell me more. Why is cell area your favorite CellProfiler feature?

0:02:47.000,0:02:50.000
Because it's the first in the list.

0:02:52.000,0:02:54.000
Primacy. There we go. I love it.

0:02:54.000,0:02:56.000
Thanks for the input.

0:02:56.000,0:02:59.000
Hi, I'm here with Kate.

0:02:59.000,0:03:04.000
Kate, important question. What's your favorite CellProfiler feature and why?

0:03:04.000,0:03:06.000
Um Let's see.

0:03:06.000,0:03:08.000
The first module that comes to mind is IdentifyDeadWorms

0:03:08.000,0:03:10.000
Because it's the best name.

0:03:10.000,0:03:16.000
But, my favorite feature, I mean Intensity does a lot.

0:03:22.000,0:03:27.000
Axis length, granularity, I don't know, it's hard to choose, there's a lot of good options

0:03:27.000,0:03:28.000
Oh, thank you so much.

0:03:30.000,0:03:33.000
All right, here with my friend Angeline, I've got a question. Woman on the Street.

0:03:33.000,0:03:35.160
Widefield or confocal?

0:03:35.134,0:03:40.160
Oh, that's a tough one.

0:03:41.134,0:03:43.134
Confocal. Alright

0:03:43.000,0:03:45.160
Because I do a lot of 3D imaging.

0:03:45.160,0:03:47.160
And so confocal is important to me.

0:03:47.160,0:03:50.160
But if you do a lot 2D, wide field is a lot faster.

0:03:50.160,0:03:52.160
So it's really what you're working on.

0:03:52.160,0:03:53.160
Yeah.

0:03:53.160,0:03:55.160
Well, I asked you, I asked you.

0:03:55.160,0:03:56.160
I know.

0:03:56.160,0:03:57.160
I know. Not what other people are working on.

0:03:58.160,0:03:59.160
I do a lot of 3D.

0:03:59.160,0:04:01.000
Alright. Confocal it is. Confocal.

0:04:01.000,0:04:02.101
Thanks

0:04:02.160,0:04:04.160
Hi, I'm here with...

0:04:04.160,0:04:06.160
Introduce yourself please.

0:04:06.160,0:04:08.160
Nasim Jamali.

0:04:08.160,0:04:10.160
Alright Nasim, what is your favorite CellProfiler feature?

0:04:10.160,0:04:11.160
Texture.

0:04:11.160,0:04:13.160
Why texture?

0:04:13.160,0:04:21.160
It just shows a different layer that is not super obvious.

0:04:21.160,0:04:25.160
It's not size, it's not shape that are obvious, so it's texture.

0:04:25.160,0:04:26.160
Ah yeah.

0:04:26.160,0:04:28.160
Confocal or wide field?

0:04:28.160,0:04:29.160
Confocal.

0:04:29.160,0:04:32.160
it's wide, it's easier, it's faster.

0:04:32.160,0:04:34.160
There you go.

0:04:34.160,0:04:39.160
Alright, women on the street here, asking Jenna,

0:04:39.160,0:04:42.160
what is your favorite CellProfiler feature?

0:04:42.160,0:04:45.160
Oh, this is a good one actually.

0:04:45.160,0:04:49.160
I love solidity actually.

0:04:49.160,0:04:51.160
Area-shape solidity.

0:04:51.160,0:04:57.160
Because I just find it very fun because nuclear are weird and can be weird when perturbations happen.

0:04:57.160,0:04:59.160
It's very fun to see the different distribution where I'm like,

0:04:59.160,0:05:04.160
oh, I need to see what's going on with that guy, he's got a low solidity, what is he doing?

0:05:04.160,0:05:07.160
So, it's very fun, just a fun feature if I can guess.

0:05:07.160,0:05:09.160
I love it, great answer.

0:05:09.160,0:05:11.160
Thank you.

0:05:11.160,0:05:13.160
I'm here with...

0:05:13.160,0:05:15.160
Paula, Jenna.

0:05:15.160,0:05:17.160
Alright, how about wide field or confocal?

0:05:17.160,0:05:19.160
Ah, confocal.

0:05:19.160,0:05:22.160
What's your favorite CellProfiler feature?

0:05:22.160,0:05:28.160
I think texture or granularity because I hide so many things that I don't really get.

0:05:28.160,0:05:30.160
Thank you so much.

0:05:30.160,0:05:32.160
Hello.

0:05:32.160,0:05:38.160
Hey everyone, this is Amit and Saivi Sabatini, I'm a senior scientist at MAK with it.

0:05:38.160,0:05:40.160
Alright, and the question for you is,

0:05:40.160,0:05:43.160
Wide field or confocal?

0:05:43.160,0:05:48.160
I guess it really depends on the application and the usage of it.

0:05:48.160,0:05:53.160
So what everybody says, take a stand, Iqwan, why don't you build your confocal?

0:05:53.160,0:06:00.160
Well, I come from a screening perspective and if I am thinking about scalability and time,

0:06:00.160,0:06:02.160
probably Wide field.

0:06:02.160,0:06:04.160
Alright, I love it.

0:06:04.160,0:06:10.160
But if you can get confocal with the same scalability and time, you can do confocal, why not?

0:06:10.160,0:06:12.160
Okay.

0:06:12.160,0:06:14.160
Wide field.

0:06:14.160,0:06:16.160
I love it, thanks.

0:06:16.160,0:06:18.160
I'm here with Jamie Cheah.

0:06:18.160,0:06:20.160
Jamie, Confocal or Wide field, and why?

0:06:20.160,0:06:23.160
Wide field because it's the only thing I know as a cell biologist.

0:06:23.160,0:06:25.160
Awesome, thank you so much.

0:06:25.160,0:06:31.160
Hello, I am here with my friend Mark Bray, you might know him from Bray et al., he loves it,

0:06:31.160,0:06:33.160
loves it when I point that out.

0:06:33.160,0:06:39.160
We are asking the hard-hitting question here of what is your favorite CellProfiler feature?

0:06:39.160,0:06:44.160
So I would have to say, in terms of modules, RunCellpose.

0:06:44.160,0:06:49.160
And the reason why, if you'd asked me to say a few years ago, I would have said identify primary

0:06:49.160,0:06:54.160
because it just does so many different things, it's not just about nuclei, it can do so much.

0:06:54.160,0:07:00.160
But there are a lot of settings to fiddle with and I found explaining that to people takes a while.

0:07:00.160,0:07:06.160
But with one cell calls, just the whole plugging functionality for one,

0:07:06.160,0:07:11.160
but also there's basically like, when it gets down to it's like three settings,

0:07:11.160,0:07:14.160
and it's kind of more or less intuitive as to what they are,

0:07:14.160,0:07:20.160
and with CellProfiler you can do it at scale, so you can run it on HBC, the AWS,

0:07:20.160,0:07:25.160
and I find it super enabling because it all collaborates with the neighborhood.

0:07:25.160,0:07:27.160
So that's my tip.

0:07:27.160,0:07:29.160
Love it, thanks for the hot take.

0:07:41.160,0:07:43.160
Thanks for watching.
