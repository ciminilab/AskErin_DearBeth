1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Erin! Hello, Beth! How are you?

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Wonderful. Even better now that I see your lovely face. How are you?

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Great! Always happy when we're on the podcast.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Love it.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Absolutely.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So, I wanted to talk today about the Image.SC forum.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Because that is a thing that we often recommend people like,

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
oh hey, go get some help from the Image.SC forum.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But what is it? How do you use it? How do you find it?

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And then how do you post there so that you can get help?

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I thought it would be a really valuable thing to actually walk people through.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That sounds great.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Alright, I'm going to share my screen.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This is the Image.SC forum. You can find it at forum.image.sc.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You can also just go to Image.SC, and that will work.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What this is, is originally started as the merger of the Image.J and the CellProfiler forums.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But what it has now turned into is this place where all of these different software tools,

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
as well as organizations that care about things like image analysis,

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
all come together and they have one central help forum.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's brilliant.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yeah. I wish this had existed when I was still in school.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This would have made a lot of things in my life so much simpler.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Because what you can do is you can just upload a picture and you can say,

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
here's my picture, here's my question, can somebody help me?

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And you don't even necessarily have to know what is the right tool for you.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This is a lot of tools. How do I know if the best way to solve my problem is actually Image.J

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
or CellProfiler or Napari or something else?

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So this way you don't actually need to know.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You can just go to one place and say, hey look, here's my picture, here's my question.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I would like some help.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's wonderful.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
If you know what tool you want to use, you can click on an individual tool

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and you can find all of the things just for that tool.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Which is great if you already know what you're doing,

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
but you can also just sort of post in one of these other categories.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And so those categories also for announcements, things like upcoming events,

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
or things that we think are going to be cool for you to watch or read,

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
things like job opportunities.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There's even a category for positive posts or for blog posts or for hi, my name is,

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Introduce Yourself to the Community.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Nice.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's actually a really lovely and friendly place to be.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And I want to say we have especially emphasized to everybody who posts there that this is a place for beginners.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We want this to be very beginner friendly.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You don't need to be an expert about image analysis to hang out here.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You just need to have an image and a question.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's wonderful.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And also, I guess, then worth pointing out that we absolutely welcome, as you said,

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
like absolutely welcome beginners, but there are also people that hang out here that are not beginners,

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
that are actually like some of the most expert experts in the field,

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
whether in image analysis in general or the creators of these tools,

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
many people in our lab hang out watching for CellProfiler questions a lot.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And we take the tool.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So we're here, we are the experts in helping you with CellProfiler questions.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And so we hang out here.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is the place to ask those sorts of questions.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So you can please beginners come ask questions.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And then also, like know that you're not sort of posting into a void or posting a bunch of other people who don't know how to help you.

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Like there are people here who do know how to help and want to help.

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah, there are in fact people who post many times per week or even say thousands of times per year.

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So creators of individual tools like Pete Bankhead is a creator of QuPath.

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Curtis Ruedin is one of the main developers of ImageJ.

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
All here hanging out to answer your questions.

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So we hope that this is a valuable resource for you.

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's a reason that we sort of point people at it a lot.

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And because this is the merger of a lot of posts that have now accumulated over the years, this forum is about seven years old and the sub profile ImageJ forums go back at least a decade before that.

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Good news is there's already a lot of information there.

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So if you're not sure like how to actually find things that you want to know about the first thing I would recommend that you do is just search.

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
There are tens of thousands of posts here.

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So you can just search a thing and see if anybody has already posted about the question that you have or if you're getting an error message you don't understand.

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You can actually post, you can post the error message and search and see if maybe somebody's already solved it.

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And one of the things I do like about how this forum software works, which is a platform called Discourse, is you can actually say, hey, this is solved by this.

74
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Nice.

75
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So you can actually go through and find what the solution is.

76
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So hopefully your question is already solved.

77
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But if it isn't, then we can also talk about how to actually write a post because that can be scary, right?

78
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah, no, any, I mean, the asking for help in general can be a scary thing and especially if you are new to the, you know, I mean, we promise you that people here are nice.

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But like, hey, go to a new place on the internet and expect nice people like that's kind of a not a given.

80
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So the standpoint would feel maybe more than a little intimidating to be new to the forum and asking for help, you know, wanting help with the question.

81
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah.

82
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So with that in mind, I've actually written up some example form posts that we can talk there in terms of like, how can you get the best help on the image.

83
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
C forum.

84
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And, you know, what I hope to sort of emphasize here is not like you must follow a strict protocol just sort of like some general best practices.

85
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So the first general best practices don't be a jerk.

86
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
If you're a jerk, people are not going to want to help you.

87
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The people who hang out in this form are generally wonderful, lovely people and they understand that generally if you're asking for help, you're not in your happiest of places.

88
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But they're usually doing this for free on their own time. And if you, you know, are not nice to them, their incentive to help you is maybe not going to be so high.

89
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah, yeah. And, you know, we can speak from personal experience that the one of the fastest ways to get us to not work on a thing is to be rude to us.

90
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Like, we love helping people. And so, you know, if you say like, hey, you know, you say, hey, I could really use your help. Thank you for your, you know, thank you for your time.

91
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah. And if you write a message like this, I am deprioritizing what you have asked for.

92
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Even if I'm already working on it.

93
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So just, you know, like, basic common sense don't be mean.

94
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The other thing that I want to say in terms of like, please try not to do this.

95
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Think about what you post before you post it.

96
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And when you post information on the farm, you're actually posting it without as sort of CC zero license.

97
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So what that means is anybody should be able to use the things that you put.

98
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And it's important for that. And I want to come back to this idea of people can search and can look and can get their questions answered and you can get your questions answered from the things that people asked before you.

99
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So if as soon as you get helped, you pull that post down, you're making the community worse for the person who comes after you, not better.

100
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So we will generally not agree to do to take down posts. It's pretty rare that we will actually ever take them down.

101
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So if you don't want to post under your real name, that's fine. You don't have to post under your own name.

102
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If you want to explain your real biology and I'll talk about this more in a second, you don't have to explain your real biology.

103
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You can just sort of post a picture and say, I want to find this thing.

104
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But don't go out and ask for help and then say, I'm going to take this help away from the community now that I'm personally settled.

105
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You know, if emergencies happen, we are reasonable. We will consider take down requests, but most of them are not granted.

106
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah, yeah. I mean, you know, you said it right there, the word community, like do remember, like you are a part of a community and we are welcoming welcoming you with open arms into our community.

107
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But every, you know, every community community, that is a hard word to get out of my mouth right now, apparently, every community member does have a level of responsibility to care for the other members of their community.

108
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yeah.

109
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But I definitely want to emphasize like you don't actually need to tell us much about you don't information that would actually lead to you being scooped or other things that might make your boss unhappy.

110
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So, in fact, if you're asking for a workflow.

111
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And what you say is, here's what I study, here's my biology.

112
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Probably that's not actually going to get you what you want, because now you're limiting a you're putting out information that maybe you don't want out there, but also be you're asking for only like this tiny community of people who study the exact thing that you study,

113
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
which might not be very many people.

114
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So it is actually better for you getting an answer in addition to, you know, your boss being less worried about putting information that you get scooped that you say, hey, I want to find the red dots in this picture.

115
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Here's a screenshot of the thing I want to find.

116
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Do you have a suggestion for what might be able to do this. This is actually a better post and is less likely to get you scooped than this post.

117
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yeah, yeah. And you know we sort of we talked about another ask Erin dear Beth episode where we talked about finding spots in images, the circle episode, as I like to call it.

118
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And I think, you know, there we we sort of similar themes in that like, it doesn't really matter what your spot is. It could be a telomere, it could be, you know, a DNA roll in E and barcoding, it could be a paroxysm, I don't know, like, none of that really matters.

119
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's the same sort of principles of I want to find a small punctate object in an image. And so all sparkles are special is what you're telling me. Absolutely, absolutely. And so this is, you know, this is a great example of that.

120
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yeah.

121
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And a screenshot is great for just sort of saying like, hey, I want you to be able to visualize and take a look at like what's going on.

122
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I will say, and we've talked about this in previous ask Erin dear Beth episodes, specifically the one about ugly images screenshots are often not good for actually doing the analysis.

123
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So if you want somebody to try to come up with a workflow for you or help you come up with a workflow, it's great to have a screenshot in the web app just to like, see what the thing is.

124
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But linking the images is also really helpful.

125
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So that somebody can actually, oftentimes people will just like write you an image a macro or make us up or further pipeline like it will just like do it for you if they think that sounds fun.

126
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
But they can't do that for you if all you've given them is a screenshot.

127
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah, and, and just to be clear, like, we're big nerds like we do actually find that fun like we will make other people's image analysis pipelines.

128
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I think they figured out we're big nerds by the fact that we have a podcast about image analysis.

129
00:13:49,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And, you know, if you say there are particular programs that you want, you can tag those programs in your post and you know people will generally not be they will certainly say like, Oh, I know you, you said you want image right but like this would be super easy and Q path but people will generally try to give you what you ask for if you ask for it nicely and

130
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
in a way that's sort of like easy to follow.

131
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So just a couple other examples, and we can we can post a PDF of this as part of the show notes but just for what some other common kinds of posts I would say the most common kinds of posts are either sort of like, besides things like, here's a job opportunity are people asking for workflows

132
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:43,000
or people asking for help fixing a workflow or people who are encountering bugs they don't understand. Those are at least the reasons I end up on the forum sort of asking questions of other people.

133
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So for fixing a workflow, we often need a little bit more information.

134
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So here's an example of like the person has said like, here's a link to my pipeline.

135
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
But all they're telling us about what's going wrong is that it doesn't work.

136
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's not really easy for me to know what doesn't work is it throwing a error or is it like not finding the right things like what do you mean it doesn't work.

137
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I will hopefully be able to ask you follow up questions. But if I don't need to ask you follow up questions I can just solve it right away. I can solve it for you right away.

138
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So a better thing is at least sort of giving you saying a post here where I'm saying here is a link to the pipeline as well as an image so that the person could actually try to run CellProfiler.

139
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And figure out why it's not working. That would at least be better as opposed to just like it doesn't work.

140
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But the more information that you give, you know, within reason we don't need to know your like whole life story.

141
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
But if you can tell us more about like what specifically isn't working the more likely we can help you.

142
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So if here I'm saying like, here's the pipeline here specifically is what isn't is good versus not good.

143
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And this can be really important because a lot of times people be like, oh, well, find the cells or find find the object like we don't necessarily know what your cells look like what your biology looks like.

144
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So like tell us like there are small spots on the top right that are good and the ones that on the bottom left are bad.

145
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You know, assume that we're smart but not necessarily know what you do for a living.

146
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yeah. And on top of this, one could. I mean, I think this is a great example that's super descriptive like great example of describing what's good and what's bad but you can take, you know, take that input image and even do, you know, give us a little annotation, go into MS paint or, you know, whatever, and draw circles around the objects as you would want CellProfiler to find them so that we understand because there's a lot of

147
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:19,000
questions that are biological tasks where maybe somebody actually does want that identified as a clump. So when you can specifically say no actually I should be finding eight individual dots here, rather than this clump of signal.

148
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
That can be really helpful again for communicating even more directly draw it out yourself.

149
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah. And people generally are really friendly and they will be happy to sort of ask follow up questions but the fewer follow up questions they have to ask the faster you get your answer.

150
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And some of our themes when it's sort of reporting a bug.

151
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
If you just tell us that there is an error.

152
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
We don't really know what error it might be or why it might be happening.

153
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You're saying it's working on one computer but not another but like, I don't know are they using the same version of cell profile or the same kind of computer.

154
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And so it can be better to say, hey, this is the version of some profile I'm using operating system I'm using.

155
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And I'm getting this specific error.

156
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Can you help me figure it out?

157
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Like this is already so much more information and depending like maybe could help you.

158
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
But it's great if you're getting an error to not just post a screenshot of it but also post the text.

159
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And that's because of that search ability that I mentioned like if you post the text and if you search the text, then that's way easier.

160
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I mean, maybe by three years from now all of the images will be like index but let's assume that they're not now.

161
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
If you search the text and include the text, it's way easier for somebody to sort of be able to figure out if somebody's had that error before.

162
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And here they're saying, you know, what kind of computer it is that it was working but then rename things and it stopped working.

163
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:17,000
More information gives about what was happening or that's happening on all of the images, not just some of the images, then like the more likely we can help you.

164
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So you can see none of these posts were very long.

165
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
They don't need to be incredibly elaborate but just giving us the basic information.

166
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
We will do our best to sort of really help you get unstuck and get that way.

167
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Absolutely.

168
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And all of these are written as CellProfiler examples because obviously that's where we hang out the most.

169
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But the exact same principles apply for any other tool that is stuck out on the forum.

170
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So you can find and replace CellProfiler with any of those other tools and follow these same suggestions.

171
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
We're not giving you again, not rules but suggestions for how to get the best help.

172
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Yeah.

173
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And I just really want to say, as Erin pointed out, we are nerds.

174
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
We like talking about this stuff.

175
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
We like helping people.

176
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And so don't worry about being perfect.

177
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
The best forum post is the one that you actually write, not the one that you thought about in your head for a while.

178
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And then we're like, oh, this is too scary.

179
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I give up.

180
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Like just come there, be friendly and nice.

181
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Give us some information and we will figure out what we don't know and what we need to find out from you.

182
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And we'll help because that is what we're here to do.

183
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Absolutely.

184
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Anything else you would add?

185
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Gosh, I think that covers it.

186
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I mean, just say one more time, like, please come to the forum.

187
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Please ask us questions.

188
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You know, use it as a tool.

189
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
We want you here.

190
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You are welcome in this community no matter your level of expertise.

191
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What a lovely note to close on.

192
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Thank you so much, Erin.

193
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Always a pleasure.

194
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Thanks Beth, you too, dear.

195
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Bye.
