1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey, Beth!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hey, Erin!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Good to see you!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You too!

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I was thinking about talking about how do we, possibly the most common question we get in the Cell Profiler Forum, which is how do I figure out how many of my objects are percent positive for a particular type of object?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Ooh, that's a nice question!

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yeah, people ask us that all the time because usually people spend lots of time making these lovely, like, protein fusions or optimizing antibodies and they want to figure out how many cells are positive for marker X.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And there's lots of ways to do it, but I have one particular that's a favorite when the marker is big and one particular that's a favorite when the objects are small.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And so I thought I might show that.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yes, please do! I want to learn your tips and tricks!

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
All right.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So this is just some data that I've grabbed from the IDR, as we often do, where we have a nuclear marker, which is here in red, a cell marker, which is here in blue.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I just left Fiji on the default colors.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And as usual, I'm opening up new images in Fiji because I think it's easy to look at new images in Fiji.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But we also have two different fluorescent proteins that are overexpressed, one that is a cell marker and one that is a nuclear marker.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And we have some cells that have one and some cells that have the other and some cells that have both.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And so I'm sure for the biologists in question, it is super important to know, probably mostly, about what are the cells that have both.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So we'll make both single positives and then the double positive.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And then I'll quickly show what happens when you want to do this with speckles.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So I have pre-loaded a CellProfiler pipeline that I spent literally just about five minutes tuning, where we can make our nuclei and our cells from our cell channel.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
These are really gorgeous images.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And so this was easy peasy.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
As always, you can find the pipelines for this episode on our website.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So I'm going to start by showing you the thing that people often do, but that is actually a less good thing to do.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So this is the less good thing. Don't do this.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So often what people will do is do something like measure object intensity, followed by filter objects.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And this will work. I'm going to show you something and it will work.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But then I'm going to explain to you why maybe it doesn't work the best.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So let's use this for our cell marker.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So let's say we have our, I've called my channels DNA cells, cell FP for cell fluorescent protein and nuclei FB for nuclei fluorescent protein.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Very imaginative. So let's say I want to measure inside the cells, the amount of cell FP.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That would be probably a good way to figure out if the cells positive or not.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm going to take advantage of the workspace viewer, which I got from this view workspace button, which is always delightful for figuring out how I can sort of put measurements on top of things.

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And so if I have my cells, I can put my measurements of my cells right on top of my image and I can get a sense of what's going on in terms of my cell to go with the mean intensity.

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So it's, I bet one or two significant figures would probably have been enough, but let's zoom in and see what we see.

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's a little bit hard to see with everything big.

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So it looks like in my cells that are negative, I have mean intensities that are really right around zero.

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And in some of the other ones, I have like point point oh one almost maybe not quite everywhere.

39
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay, so that one thing that I can do is I can say I'm going to use the filter objects module.

40
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And I can sort of say I only want to keep cells that are above let's let's say point oh seven intensity. And this will work.

41
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So I'm going to say I have cells, I want to limit their intensity and their mean intensity in the fluorescent protein image, such that I don't care about the maximum mean intensity.

42
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But I want the minimum mean intensity to be point oh seven and I got that just from sort of looking around.

43
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And so, if I do that, we end up with about half of ourselves which sort of order of magnitude seems right to me.

44
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And just for fun, because I want to sort of see what's going on here.

45
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I could make an overlay outlines module and I probably will eventually.

46
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But if this were a real project, but for now I can just use the workspace viewer, I can turn off the font thing.

47
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And I can say, show me in pink all the cells that were marked as fluorescent protein positive and all the ones that are not are still marked in green but because the pink gets drawn on top of the green, what we end up with is sort of a pink green mask.

48
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah, that seems to have worked fine.

49
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah, I can see now a few cells that maybe if I were manually annotating I would have thrown into a different bucket but

50
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:26,000
it seems like for a situation where you have really, really clear difference between, you know, signal or not.

51
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah, this is not an unreasonable thing to do.

52
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah, the reason I don't like this is what if tomorrow you turn up your gain on your microscope, just a very little bit.

53
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Maybe point oh six isn't the right number anymore. And I have to go through that process that I just did of like going through and looking at a bunch of cells and looking at the measurements and it's just it takes a while.

54
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's not that but it takes a while.

55
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So my actually preferred way of doing this so now we're going to show you the one that I do like is to start by actually thresholding the image.

56
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Of the image that we're going to use to sort of call positive or negative. So here I'm going to do it for the nuclear.

57
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And the reason I like this is because self-referring thresholding methods are pretty adaptable as long as the sort of shape of the distribution doesn't change as long as sort of, you know, your stuff is sort of about the same percent bright and dim.

58
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You can adjust the gain on your microscope to X tomorrow, and it doesn't really matter because CellProfiler's thresholding modules just sort of deal with that.

59
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Here my nuclei are super dim so I'm going to do what I often do in the situation which is change my default visualization settings.

60
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So that I can be able to sort of quickly tune lots of things and see if things look good.

61
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But that was apparently not the right number so maybe I should just actually try to figure out what the right number is instead of guess.

62
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Okay, what if I don't do what normalize and just do regular normalized. Okay, that is better.

63
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I can also make this picture better too.

64
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But what we can sort of see right now in our very incorrectly thresholded image is there are actually a bunch of like dimmer things in addition to the brighter things and that's what thresholding works really well at coping with.

65
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So I'm just going to change this to normalized or I'm going to stay with log. I just sort of do it way higher.

66
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What can I say I'm chaotic.

67
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So now we can see both our dim cells and our bright cells.

68
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:13,000
These have a value of point about point oh two. These have a value of like point oh one so these are literally five times brighter, but I'm going to go ahead and assume that as the biologist I care about and I want both.

69
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Hopefully a way that's going to help me get both pretty easily is by using the three class OZ thresholding method and CellProfiler in this particular case because what that says is, hey, CellProfiler there's going to be three kinds of pixel intensity in this image there's going to be background is going to be dim stuff and there's going to be bright stuff.

70
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And you can decide what you want to do with that middle class so here I want to keep the sort of dim stuff.

71
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So I can say that I want to keep the middle channel in the foreground.

72
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But if I didn't if I decided no actually I only want the super bright cells.

73
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I could just set that to background.

74
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Look at that.

75
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Super.

76
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I love when you know the theory actually works.

77
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So, if you have your thing thresholded which as you can see is very adaptable.

78
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Then we can use the mask objects module instead of the filter objects module in order to figure out our flesh and protein positive nuclei.

79
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Just to point out in your threshold, like you didn't set any specific cutoffs right so it's dependent you know it is finding it doesn't matter if your relative intensities from one day to another are different.

80
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That the.

81
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah, that's that's a handy tip.

82
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah.

83
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And so what I can do with mask objects so I've said that I want to mask my nuclear image I want to do it with this thresholded image.

84
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And here's the magic button.

85
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The handling of objects should be set to remove depending on overlap so here you can say keep this object if it overlaps by X percent.

86
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So here I'm going to just start with my default which is 50%.

87
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And so any cells that are nuclei positive or that are 50% covered get kept anything else gets thrown away.

88
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And just because these ones are relatively rare, and I happen to have them open side by side I can automatically see like this looks pretty good though I could have gone into the workspace here to do that also.

89
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Awesome.

90
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And that's not magic, Beth. Like I mean, a really fun thing to point out in that there are so many different things that CellProfiler can do.

91
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And so many different settings you can tune, but that, you know, sometimes it takes having an expert who is familiar with all these different options to show you, like hey this is actually quite an easy thing, you know once you've been introduced to this anybody can replicate this in their

92
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:13,000
workflow, but may not you know an average biologist just starting to think about the thinking around identifying objects in a quantitative and reproducible manner might not think to piece together these tools in this way.

93
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah.

94
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And the downside of CellProfiler having so many things that can do is it has so many things you can do and sometimes it can be hard, you know, to figure out what is the best way like this is a way that will work this is a totally reasonable way, but this is my favorite way.

95
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I also like using mass objects then for figuring out our double positives. And so once we have single positives, very often what we want is our double positives. So I'm going to start with my fp positive cells.

96
00:12:44,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And then, and I'm going to say, fp positive cells should be cells that have fp positive nuclei on them. And now I'm going to change this handling thing again so if I change this to keep overlapping region we can see what what will happen, which is, it would only keep the

97
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:19,000
cell that were actually overlapping, which is possibly what I want, but probably not if what I care about ourselves.

98
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:30,000
But I can just change it to keep. So now, if the if there's a fluorescent protein positive nuclei on top of a fluorescent protein positive cell, it will just keep the whole cell.

99
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Wow.

100
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Look at that. And so now I have a thing that does only my fluorescent positive cells. And if I wanted the double positive new nuclei, all I would have to do is sort of take this and reverse it, or I start with a fluorescent positive nuclei.

101
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And then I mask them with the first positive cells.

102
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And then I could do whatever measurements and things that I wanted.

103
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And no, are my measurements coming for I could decide if I want to measure only the fluorescent positive cells in nuclei I could decide, I want to measure all of them but I then just want to see, like, are they positive or not.

104
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
All of these things would then be possible.

105
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I just need to know exactly what's the biology that I want to measure here.

106
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So, for all the questions that we get about this, it's really just a matter of knowing the right tricks. And then you're usually in really good shape.

107
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's awesome. I wouldn't even have necessarily thought or known to assemble these widgets, aka modules in this exact manner. This is this is lovely, but thank you.

108
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:53,000
If we've got time, I want to show you one more quick thing, which is this is great for when I can say, alright, my thing should be like 50% positive.

109
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
That's great. When we have things like this that fill the whole nucleus or the whole cell. But if you remember back to our sparkly episode.

110
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That is not always the case and sometimes we just have a few little sparkles.

111
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So, I want to quickly show what you would do in that case, because it's going to just add one module in addition to the module that we built in that episode.

112
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So, if I tell CellProfiler to open my speckly project instead.

113
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So here. Oh, no.

114
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It doesn't seem like I saved the final thing. Oh, bummer.

115
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Okay. I'm going to quickly add my speckly objects into this pipeline.

116
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Do you do do do do do do do.

117
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Maybe I'm not allowed to hum that the copyrighted tune.

118
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Probably.

119
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Probably.

120
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I think I had.

121
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And we definitely want to use robust background here. And if you don't know why go check out that episode.

122
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The sparkles a.k.a. speckles episode.

123
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yes.

124
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm going to use relate objects to now say I want to know for each pseudo cell how many speckles slash sparkles of Channel three that I have.

125
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And so we now have in relate objects we can see that our objects are spots here are colored by the number of cells that are on top of.

126
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So that mass object trick is great for when your marker covers a lot of your object.

127
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,000
If it doesn't, this is the better trick is to do relate objects. And now we are actually going to use filter objects.

128
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And we're going to say I want to sort of only keep things with a certain number. So

129
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And so we're going to use filter objects.

130
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And we're going to use filter objects.

131
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And we're going to use filter objects.

132
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And we're going to use filter objects.

133
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So.

134
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And

135
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So here I'm going to say that I have a thing called cells with lots of speckles.

136
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm going to say I want only cells that have I don't care about the maximum here.

137
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I only want ones that have at least 10 speckles.

138
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And so hopefully that is also a thing that is going to be relatively sort of experiment to experiment relatively consistent. So that's two of my 19 cells.

So the more you can think about what's going to be consistent next month to experiment, the more you can make a pipeline that you don't have to adjust every time you do an experiment.

140
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That's a great great principle to think about. Certainly for this use case, but just building building quantitative bio image analysis pipelines in general.

141
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
A really good thing to keep forefront in your mind as you work on any new pipeline.

142
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yeah, I want folks to generally be lazier at building pipelines and the way you make them lazy but still useful is by thinking about what's going to change each time and not building your pipelines around that.

143
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Absolutely.

144
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Well, thank you so much for letting me show you all my favorite tips and tricks.

145
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I love it. I'm even learning new things. This is delightful. I hope this was useful for other folks as well. I'm sure it will be given how often we are asked how to do this very thing.

146
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
All right, see you next time.

147
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Sounds good. Bye.
