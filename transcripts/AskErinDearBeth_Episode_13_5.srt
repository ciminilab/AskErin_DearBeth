1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hey Beth, hello.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,720
Okay, so bonus episode time.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,680
We are not going to talk science because we are nerds of many interests.

4
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,720
Many shared nerderies.

5
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,720
Many shared nerderies between us.

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:39,960
Yeah, so we thought we could chat for a minute about a different shared nerdery that is Great

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,280
British Baking Show or Bake Off.

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,560
We're getting a new season soon.

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,080
So soon, as in like this week.

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,800
Yeah, so probably even by the time I get this posted, it will have already started because

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,800
I think the first episode already aired in Britain and then it's a few days later before

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,960
it airs here.

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:11,000
So yeah, we are like we are right at the start of what is the season 15?

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What season is this?

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,080
I don't know.

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,080
Yeah.

17
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,000
16, I think.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,240
I think that's yeah.

19
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,240
I think it's probably 16.

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,240
That's a lot of bake-offs.

21
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,520
Okay, so for those that are not in the know, I suppose, I mean probably people are, if

22
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,520
they're not in the know, they're like, oh, I don't want to watch this episode, right?

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,680
But like for anybody that doesn't know, there's been the Great British Bake Off, also known

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:50,560
as GBBO, that is a reality show that is from Britain, as one might expect by the name,

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,320
a pretty competition where the bakers compete, you know, like any sort of generic competition

26
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,880
show like starts with a big group and each week, you know, they drop another person until

27
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:10,200
you get to the end and there's a winner and they're competing by baking, which, okay,

28
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,400
sure.

29
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,000
So let's go into like why we love that.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,320
I think, okay, yes, you and I both like to bake and we can nerd out about that too, but

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,800
I think the thing for me, like I am not into reality TV at all.

32
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Like I don't watch much TV to begin with because I have 400 things that I've, you know, there's

33
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,480
always like too many things to do.

34
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,560
So it never quite makes it to the top of my, anyway, that's a whole other thing.

35
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,360
The thing is, I know, I know, get me chatting and I'm like not able to follow a single conversational

36
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
path.

37
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,640
The thing I love about Bake Off the Most though is just how kind the people are on the show.

38
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Right?

39
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,480
Like it may be a competition, but you have, but like very regularly, especially when you

40
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,280
get into a season when they like really get to know each other and become good friends,

41
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,680
like it's not just the person leaves that's crying.

42
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,320
It's like they announced somebody's leaving.

43
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,040
I'm like, everybody starts crying because they're like, no, I was like, I love you and

44
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,760
support you and you're a delight and a friend.

45
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,040
I feel like with Bake Off they are there to make friends.

46
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,040
Yes, absolutely.

47
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,320
Like the opposite of normal reality TV.

48
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,320
Yeah.

49
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,040
So that is, I think, a huge reason.

50
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,760
I love it and a huge reason why, yeah, why I am perpetually drawn back to it and can

51
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,960
even go and like rewatch old seasons.

52
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,840
It's like it's not about who wins.

53
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:46,320
I also like learning about sweets and all sorts of things that I like very much have

54
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,280
never heard of and be like, ooh, that's a cool thing.

55
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,080
Maybe I will try to make that someday.

56
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,080
Yes.

57
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:59,960
Yeah, I have definitely learned a lot about baking by watching Bake Off in part, especially

58
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:06,480
like the last several years because we've got kind of a crazy thing in my family around

59
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,480
Bake Off.

60
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:16,360
So a chunk of my family, well, so I'll say like this didn't seem, okay, there's a chunk

61
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:22,400
of my family that's like super into sports and many of them do sports, fantasy leagues.

62
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,680
They watch sports of all kinds together.

63
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,560
I mean, I even have a family member who was a professional athlete.

64
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,960
Like lots of sports going on.

65
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,320
That didn't, I didn't inherit that.

66
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:41,120
I am not a sports person, but that's like where the idea got started of having a fantasy

67
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,080
Bake Off league.

68
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,960
So my family, what?

69
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
Yes.

70
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
Yes.

71
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:54,120
So my family every year now for a number of years, we have drafted, had a draft where

72
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,880
we each get to pick to bake off.

73
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,480
You know, it's like it's a whole sports draft.

74
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
We have a commissioner.

75
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
Zachary is the commissioner.

76
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,640
You know, commissioner Zachary, he handles, you know, handles the rules and the drafting,

77
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,920
Tally's points.

78
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,160
And we each end up- Is it always the same commissioner?

79
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
Yes.

80
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Yes.

81
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,080
No, it's, it all is always commissioners that because nobody, nobody can do better than

82
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
he can.

83
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,120
Zach, and he sends, oh my gosh, like the best emails.

84
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,680
He's so witty, like, you know, adore Zach and appreciate him so much for his efforts

85
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,880
in our Bake Off league.

86
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,360
So we, you know, we do a family draft.

87
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,160
In fact, ours is tonight after dinner.

88
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,000
We're all getting on Zoom and doing the draft.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,720
And so each team gets to pick two bakers.

90
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,600
And then there's points given every week based on how long they stay in the show.

91
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,640
So each episode, there's like more points.

92
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,680
If somebody gets a Hollywood handshake, there's bonus points.

93
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,400
If they get star baker, if they win the technical challenge.

94
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,560
And we track those points and there's the winner at the end.

95
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,000
The funny thing is, I think Stephen and Maria have won every single time.

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,160
And they're perhaps the least bakery of the like households, but the most sporty of the

97
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
household.

98
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,320
So somehow their like sports knowledge seems to-

99
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,160
They've drafted in other things.

100
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,280
They've drafted in other things.

101
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
I don't know.

102
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,680
I don't understand why Stephen and Maria are able to win every year in the draft, but

103
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,800
they do and I adore them for it.

104
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,360
Because they probably are, yes, bake.

105
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,760
Is there a prize?

106
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,760
Would you win something?

107
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,760
Yeah.

108
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,680
And we have an engraved platter of family Bake Off winner.

109
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
Yeah.

110
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
No, it's a full thing.

111
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:02,160
And there is also, we have a spirit points competition, which has changed slightly in

112
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,520
how we calculate the points over the years.

113
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,080
I like how we did it originally because I always won.

114
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,080
Well, of course.

115
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,080
You know, of course.

116
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,080
That's not the like.

117
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
Yeah.

118
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:20,040
Well, so actually, so the first couple of years I won kind of hands down because I work

119
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
from home.

120
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,400
My office is in my basement.

121
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,600
So it was very easy for me.

122
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,880
Like I get up early in the morning with my daughter, I get dough going or, you know, whatever.

123
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,240
And then like, since I'm at home, I can just like pop up in between meetings and like,

124
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,720
oh, I need to need my dough.

125
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,480
Like, oh, so this actually involves baking.

126
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,040
So the spirit points is about baking.

127
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Yeah.

128
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:50,440
So you get points for baking during each week.

129
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,400
Initially it was just like baking.

130
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,240
You got bonus points if you baked the technical.

131
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:05,000
So I have actually baked many of the technical recipes from the last several years of bake

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,920
off, if not most of them.

133
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:16,720
I have to say, you know, including you and I one time got you got the ingredients.

134
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,160
I was visiting Boston and we were all set to bake the pithivier.

135
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,080
I will always remember.

136
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,400
I'm not even talking to find a pithivier, but it was like a pithivier.

137
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:32,160
And we were all set to bake it at the hotel, you know, staying in like one of the hotels

138
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,040
with kitchenettes until we then realized that we couldn't actually do that during our work

139
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,080
day because it didn't have an oven, just a cooktop and a microwave.

140
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,320
Yes.

141
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,240
Note to folks who live in the Pacific Northwest, Aaron has a lot of baked goods.

142
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,480
And this is a good friend to have.

143
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
Yes.

144
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,880
So, OK, so it was just based on like, you know, how much you baked, but then a couple

145
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,400
plot twists in the, you know, in things.

146
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,360
So I was the only person working from home.

147
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,480
You know, I have family, like one household, they're both lawyers, like not an option to

148
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,560
move dough around during the day.

149
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:15,640
Other households, like teachers also not an option to like be at home and like, you know,

150
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,880
do in and out of the oven between meetings.

151
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:25,760
Then there was the year that my aunt Deborah retired and then it was a heated race between

152
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:32,600
me and her because once she retired, she had a heck of a lot more time to bake and was home.

153
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:40,600
And so then heated race, I think she won that year, you know, begrudgingly excited for her

154
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,840
because I was glad she got to retire.

155
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:50,240
And then we have since shifted now to sort of even the playing field for those that do

156
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,400
not work from home and or are retired.

157
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:01,720
Spirit points are based on, you know, you get a point for baking that week, anything.

158
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,280
You can get an extra point if it is on theme.

159
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,160
So it doesn't have to be the technical recipe.

160
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,400
It just needs to be like on theme for the week.

161
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,600
And in part, the driving decision behind that was concordant with the third point you can get

162
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,480
for baking gluten free because in the middle of our family's obsession with bake off, four of my

163
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,880
family members were diagnosed as celiac.

164
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,560
And that's a problem.

165
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:27,920
Yeah.

166
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,560
Yeah.

167
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,560
So making it impossible to follow most of the technical recipes and and for those that are not

168
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,040
major bakers like gluten.

169
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,120
So celiac is an allergy to gluten and gluten is a huge, huge.

170
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:51,240
It's it's a protein protein that's naturally in most grains that we bake with, particularly wheat

171
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,040
is generally quite high in gluten.

172
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,040
There are some that are like low in gluten and some very few grains that we bake with that are gluten free,

173
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,680
including buckwheat.

174
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,160
For anybody that's ever confused by that buckwheat isn't a wheat.

175
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,560
It is actually anyway, I have so many things to say about gluten now that I have family members

176
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:17,440
that are allergic and a severe allergy, like can't can't even like can't eat anything that comes out

177
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,400
of my household, even if it is not even if I bake something that doesn't have gluten in it,

178
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,160
like any level of contamination is dangerous.

179
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,400
So so then we added in the extra bonus point for if you bake something gluten free, you get an extra

180
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,240
bonus point because it's a lot harder because that gluten is actually what gives structure

181
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,000
to everything every baked good basically.

182
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,920
So it's a lot harder to do gluten free baking.

183
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,520
So that was a whole lot of I'm sorry you get me started on this and I just have a whole lot to say.

184
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,520
I don't think this if people are hanging out here wanting to hear a stockpile group break off,

185
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,640
that is an excellent story.

186
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,160
Yeah, so very excited for this year.

187
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,880
We'll see what happens.

188
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,040
So we had a funny thing.

189
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,240
Okay, last last two family anecdotes around bake off on our draft last year.

190
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,480
I won't say any spoilers, but I will say there was

191
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,720
there was a so we actually formed a leftovers team because we we used to draft.

192
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,560
We'd watch the first episode and then draft, which left us we had five teams and they start

193
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,080
with 12 bakers.

194
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,720
So that left so one person leaves during the first episode that left us drafting 10

195
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,160
out of the remaining 11 and one person would just go undrafted.

196
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,760
Well, the only thing I'll say is last year in the first episode they didn't end up

197
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,920
sending anybody home.

198
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,640
So we had a full leftovers team with the two undrafted people and in a twist of fate last year

199
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,640
the leftovers actually won our whole family.

200
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,880
Draft so we all failed.

201
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,440
Stephen and Maria aren't actually the winners every year if we count the leftovers.

202
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,480
Yeah, we thought that I love the dedication though to the tracking that you tracked the

203
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,840
undrafted people.

204
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,440
Yeah, I am not I mean I am not the only person that likes accurate record keeping.

205
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,040
It turns out that it's a family trait.

206
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,000
It's a family trait.

207
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:32,560
We've got mathematicians, we've got lawyers, there's a lot of structured thinking happening.

208
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:42,240
So yeah, that was I'll stop talking about that but I'm looking forward to baking off

209
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:50,480
starting again and that extra motivation to try things that I don't actually even think I want

210
00:13:50,480 --> 00:14:01,680
to bake but end up being a really cool learning experience and often like something fun and tasty.

211
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,920
And it's definitely a great show that is fun for the whole family like my husband and I watch it

212
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,880
together I know you watch it with your your husband and daughter like.

213
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:19,920
Absolutely, yeah it's super fun, super friendly and just much like ourselves fun and friendly.

214
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:28,160
Yeah, it's just so positive and if you enjoy baking or I mean you know your your husband

215
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,960
and my husband aren't I would not put them in the category of enjoy baking like you don't actually

216
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:42,560
even have to enjoy baking you know enjoy fun positive competition.

217
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:52,400
Yeah, do you have a favorite like do you have a favorite anything like a recipe or an episode or a

218
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:59,360
person like any favorite to share? Well, person is hard without going into spoilers though I will say

219
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,040
I did love that there has been one computational biology postdoc on the Great British Bake Off

220
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:11,920
I thought was great. Yes, representing those of us women in computational biology

221
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:22,080
but probably my favorite recipe is there is a smoked salmon soda bread from the COVID season

222
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,920
so it would have come out about 2021 so it's probably season 11 give or take that is so delicious

223
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:34,720
and so good and we still make it at home. Yes, absolutely I can second that I've made that one too

224
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:40,320
yeah it's uh we can jot these in our show notes or means smoked salmon and chive soda bread.

225
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:48,880
Yes, absolutely fabulous. That's a great one I think I you know a favorite of mine

226
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,040
surprisingly I think this is the one that stands out in my head the most these Devonshire splits

227
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,840
you know just beautiful like not actually that hard I mean they look stunning and

228
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,360
you know my finish work is never the strongest part of my baking we'll just leave it at that

229
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:16,160
but even you know even mine like came out looking much like this photo so I would you know

230
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,080
I would encourage this was a fun one and I love strawberries and like strawberries and whipped

231
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:28,640
cream on like a fluffy white you know sweet white bread like not not too hard to have experienced

232
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,360
baking bread this is this is one and I think even you know the this one the soda bread like

233
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,720
one of the easier soda bread is one of the easiest breads to bake so you don't even need

234
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,400
much experience baking bread I think it was the first thing my husband ever baked was made this

235
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:50,000
after I made it once so yeah yeah so this like even if you're not much of a baker yourself

236
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,680
recommend these couple of recipes so yeah I think I might need to buy some strawberries on my way home

237
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,240
yes I mean Wynn doesn't want me to buy like it's Friday afternoon what am I going to do I'm going
