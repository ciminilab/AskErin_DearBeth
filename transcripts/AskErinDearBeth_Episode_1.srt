00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome to our inaugural episode of Ask Erin Dear Beth,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
in which we tackle our first image analysis problem.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Phrased to us as blurry images,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,160
we are going to be doing some object segmentation in some difficult images.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,320
Here, I have a folder of blurred images,

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,200
image set one and image set two.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:37,200
Can anybody provide more information about what the task is for these blurred images?

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Sure, since I uploaded it, probably I can go ahead and give a context of these two folders there.

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Yes, there were a lot of the channels DAPI and the GP channel, the Golgi and the Plasma Membrane channel,

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,200
had a lot of blurriness.

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:04,200
It's visible in all the channels as well, since we used DAPI and the Golgi Plasma Membrane for segmenting cells and the nuclei.

12
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:10,200
So the main aim is to segment cell and the nuclei eliminating all these blurriness.

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,200
And image set one has one set of images where we can kind of get rid of those based on size,

14
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,200
but this image set two has blurriness both in GP as well, the Golgi and Plasma Membrane as well as the DAPI channel.

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
So, yeah.

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,200
All right, so we are trying to segment these.

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:40,200
We need nuclei segmented, we need cells segmented, but we're facing the issue of the blurriness is getting the way of the ability to segment these images.

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,200
So let us...

19
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Just...

20
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Ooh, yeah, look at that.

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:55,200
Okay, so here we have just as a quick glance at the images.

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,200
It's like, here's our DAPI.

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,200
And this looks like mostly blurriness from just cells going on top of each other.

24
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,200
Certain cell types just really don't like to sit in pretty flat sheets.

25
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,200
They're just like all up in each other's business.

26
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:19,200
Yeah, which then you have the out of focus cells on top of...

27
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
You can sort of see...

28
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:29,200
Because you have too many focal planes going on here, but still all of the fluorescent signal visible from those multiple images.

29
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Okay, so if we're going to do this in CellProfiler, first thing we need to do is get some information.

30
00:02:50,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Name the channels here so we can handle them in CellProfiler.

31
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,200
I don't know if we need to metadata. I don't know if we need to go that far.

32
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:14,200
Well, we have two different... Okay, we can go names and types.

33
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,200
I'm just going to be contrary for the sake of being contrary now.

34
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,200
We have to generate drama.

35
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
Yes.

36
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Okay, so we have...

37
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Channel 6.

38
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,200
We said channel 6 is the DAPI.

39
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,200
So just CH6 is in the name.

40
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,200
So we can take a little bit more room to type.

41
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
No, no more room to type.

42
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,200
It will in a second. As soon as you type into it, the box will...

43
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Like if you go now to a different module and come back, the box will get bigger.

44
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,200
It's a very frustrating refresh.

45
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,200
All right, so those are DNA.

46
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,200
And if you hit duplicate, you'll at least get boxes with the right size.

47
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Oh, too late.

48
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,200
Okay, all right, all right.

49
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,200
Well, remove this image and then duplicate this one.

50
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,200
There we go.

51
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Okay, and the other channel to use for segmentation.

52
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:24,200
So we often use RNA as a segmentation because it...

53
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,200
Like for segmenting cells, because it's sort of bright in the ins...

54
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,200
You know, more concentrated towards the interior of the cell

55
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,200
than sort of fades out towards the edges.

56
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,200
It sounds like...

57
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Suganya, you were saying you were using a different channel.

58
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
Those look very...

59
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:47,200
Yeah, I was using RNA to identify the pre-cells and then use the Golgi and Plasma membrane

60
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,200
to get the boundary of the cells that were...

61
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,200
Which channel? These look so...

62
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Channel 2 is Golgi and Plasma membrane.

63
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
Okay.

64
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Hmm, all right.

65
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,200
And then channel 3 is the RNA?

66
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,200
Um, I'm not gonna say...

67
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Yeah, channel 3 is the RNA.

68
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:21,200
Okay, so...

69
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,200
RNA, oh, we won't.

70
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Oh, uh...

71
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,200
All right, that's probably enough.

72
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
There we go.

73
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,200
We've got our three channels with names, two different image sets.

74
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Okay, so if we go into...

75
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:53,200
Let's just jump right into Identify Primary and see what happens.

76
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,200
So, you know, many other tricks we can do,

77
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,200
but let's just see what this looks like.

78
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:08,200
So, I guess another possible thing is...

79
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Suganya, if you had a pipeline that got you some of the way there,

80
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
we could...

81
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
Yeah, I can share the pipeline.

82
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Like, yes, that worked for the image set 1, but the image set 2,

83
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
I'd like to figure it out.

84
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,200
I can quickly share the bucket once again.

85
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,200
I can do the start test mode there.

86
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Let's see.

87
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
Oh, yeah, popping up on my other screen.

88
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,200
Okay, so...

89
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Here's what we get without doing...

90
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
You know, without tuning anything.

91
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:51,200
And you can see this looks awful, not helpful at all.

92
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,200
So...

93
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,200
We have very over-segmented cells,

94
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
and we have...

95
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Or sorry, nuclei, and we have nuclei of the right sizes being filtered out.

96
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,200
So, definitely need to change things.

97
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:20,200
So, here, you know, I have all this, like, okay, this is...

98
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Math in head.

99
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Well, 60 to 1320, that's 60.

100
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Yeah, there is a measure length tool.

101
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,200
There is.

102
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,200
One could do that, all right.

103
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,200
Let's see, you know, I should be able to count to 60 in my head,

104
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:46,200
but that's more of Beth's expertise, the whole, you know, math in head thing.

105
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Yeah, again, you know, or we can...

106
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
No.

107
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,200
I'll have to share the pipeline if you'd like to.

108
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Awesome, here we can...

109
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
All right.

110
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,200
So, rather than, like, tune with...

111
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Start from scratch on tuning.

112
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Let's...

113
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Let us start with something that we know is...

114
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Sort of working.

115
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Okay, rather than using load data...

116
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
Oh, we gotta go back and do this again.

117
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Okay.

118
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Do-do-do, gonna do this real fast.

119
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:48,200
So, we have six is DNA, and then we have...

120
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Channel three, RNA, and...

121
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Channel two.

122
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
There we go.

123
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Okay.

124
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:14,200
So...

125
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Oh, GP.

126
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Well, you don't have the one functions anyway, do you?

127
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
So...

128
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
No, we can just ignore that.

129
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
Okay.

130
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Thank you.

131
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,200
My demonstrations.

132
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
Okay.

133
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,200
So...

134
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Let's see what we've got with the first image here for IDing...

135
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Nuclei.

136
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Okay.

137
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:51,200
So, here, we're clearly at the parameters getting a good job of finding, like, good nuclei,

138
00:09:51,200 --> 00:10:03,200
but also struggling with sort of these out-of-focus areas being identified as very large nuclei.

139
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:14,200
So, it looks like sort of already having here the approach of measuring the size and shape of these all nuclei,

140
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:23,200
then filtering them based on size, like reasonable area size, down to, you know,

141
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,200
keeping only the actual nuclei and moving forward with that.

142
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
I think...

143
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Okay.

144
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,200
So, first, we can talk like big picture in terms of like...

145
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Okay.

146
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Well, first you're saying it worked here, but it's not working on your next image set.

147
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Yes.

148
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,200
Like, based on what UNBET suggested, I kind of masked the objects based on the size of the nuclei.

149
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:56,200
So, I was able to eliminate the cells wherever it is blurred based on the bigger nuclei.

150
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,200
And I also identified the secondary cells having the bigger nuclei in and later masked the objects,

151
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
which had the bigger nuclei.

152
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,200
What happens in those cases is like the secondary nuclei, like, since there is this work for the first image set,

153
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:16,200
but the second image set, the blurriness is also super visible in the GP channel.

154
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,200
So, the secondary cells are like too big and the nuclei are not that bigger.

155
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Like, the nuclei is in the normal range.

156
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,200
So, those cells are not getting eliminated.

157
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,200
If I try to eliminate based on the blurriness in the Caulkey channel,

158
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,200
then the actual cells, which are bigger with proper nuclei are also getting eliminated.

159
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Okay.

160
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:57,200
So, if we go all the way through looking at the ID secondary.

161
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
Okay, so we're back to the first image set now.

162
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,200
So, you're saying we've got something that works here.

163
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Okay.

164
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Let's see what's working.

165
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Okay.

166
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200
We're not back to the first image set.

167
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
We are.

168
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
Oh, yeah.

169
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
Okay.

170
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
We are.

171
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:28,200
So, here, strategy was to ID primary.

172
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Right.

173
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,200
So, we've got those big blobs in, then measure them, then use those to ID secondary.

174
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:41,200
So, here in the ID secondary.

175
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
Just this contrast.

176
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Ooh, not quite that much.

177
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Okay.

178
00:12:51,200 --> 00:13:02,200
So, if we sort of zoom in, there's sort of some areas where those are, you know, reasonable

179
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
cells.

180
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:11,200
And then some areas where clearly like this is a big blob of stuff.

181
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,200
So, we need this not, not big blob of stuff.

182
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
Okay.

183
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:26,200
Then the filter objects, you are filtering out the nuclei by the shape.

184
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
So, this is working nicely.

185
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:38,200
So, you have the original all of them and then it filters into the like keeping the nuclei and then the unwanted nuclei. Totally reasonable.

186
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,200
And then masking objects here.

187
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:53,200
What you have done is remove the unwanted nucleus associated with the unwanted nuclei.

188
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
Yeah.

189
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:01,200
And then you can filter objects as that stupid bug in it.

190
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Cool.

191
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,200
So, this is what's left.

192
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
So, that's reasonable.

193
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Like not unhappy with that function.

194
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:22,200
But the idea then is in the next image set to see what is not working there.

195
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,200
And it's not working because of blurriness in the other channels.

196
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:36,200
So, let's check that out.

197
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:44,200
Beth, do you want to say more about the bug we currently have that is what, what might we do differently if there was not a specific bug happening.

198
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:50,200
We might not need to use mask objects to remove the cells from the nuclei.

199
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:57,200
If filter objects were not broken in terms of the filter other objects based on this first filtering.

200
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,200
But it is.

201
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Okay.

202
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,200
So, primary objects.

203
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
We saw that already.

204
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
That's not unreasonable.

205
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Then secondary objects.

206
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Look at that.

207
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:25,200
So, this is your one thing I noticed here is your threshold correction factor is 0.4, which is almost never a good idea to have it that low.

208
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,200
So, I think that's part of your trouble.

209
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:43,200
The thing is like, I'm not able to get to the boundaries. If I don't have the threshold correct like boundaries are in the like normal images, if I don't have the threshold correction factor to point for and also the lower bounds to point zero one.

210
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:51,200
That's why I have this so that in the normal looking images, this setting kind of identifies the boundaries very well.

211
00:15:51,200 --> 00:16:01,200
That is why I had the correction factor point for and also show you what to point zero one.

212
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Yeah.

213
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:14,200
So the boundaries looked a little big on the other one to Aaron how how what is the number that you get when you sort of try to go in a little tighter on what should be sort of the real boundaries.

214
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:33,200
And a little tricky, you know, again, like definitely tricky on this image because it's so fuzzy but if we look at an area where we can sort of see like this should be, you know, should be kind of an, that's funny because it looks like the nucleus is sort of off the edge of the cell.

215
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:47,200
Sometimes, you know, like, there's just none of this images really actually in focus might be, you know, maybe part of part of the problem.

216
00:16:47,200 --> 00:17:01,200
But if I, you know, seems like this should be tighter in up here so sort of intensity of point oh for something.

217
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:18,200
You know, would bring it in sort of closer to the edge of the cell. I mean, I guess, you know, this takes us to a sort of bigger picture philosophical question of like, is it really even worth it, trying to make measurements on cells in this image, you know, like, some of it's going to depend on how precious your

218
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:35,200
images are how widespread this is across your data set. Another approach could be to, you know, make measurements find find images that look like this flag them and get rid of them from your measurements.

219
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:43,200
And, you know, we could certainly.

220
00:17:43,200 --> 00:18:01,200
Yeah, so I guess that's that Beth what do you like, what would you start what would you do here. I, the first thing I would do is I go back to the working image and I would get a sense of what the how different the boundaries are like.

221
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:23,200
And so I think that was, they were already a little loose in the other image and so it might be the point oh for as a perfectly fine minimum in both images, or it might not be but if it is that's the easiest way to fix this problem and I like easy.

222
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:33,200
So here looks like this is hitting the threshold minimum point oh one, but if we just try.

223
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,200
Oh four.

224
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,200
And see what it looks like.

225
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Yeah, that's way too much. Yeah.

226
00:18:49,200 --> 00:19:02,200
So one option, then would be to do a block based elimination correction and try to remove some of this out of focus nonsense. I don't know how you feel about that Aaron, I don't know what your preferred next thing would be.

227
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:08,200
I mean, my preferred next thing would probably be like find a way to identify these images and trash them.

228
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:21,200
If we're going to like go on the assumption that this is precious data and we need to like we need to figure out how to get stuff out of them. I'm, yeah, I'm fine with that.

229
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Yeah, we can do we can certainly do that. And so.

230
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:32,200
So before we get into identifying primary objects, we would want to add.

231
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,200
I mean, you've got correct information calculate and apply right there.

232
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,200
But I've clicked on to add a new thing. Okay.

233
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,200
It looks like once upon a time somebody did that.

234
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Yeah.

235
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,200
eyeballs.

236
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:01,200
You've got eyeballs. Yeah, your face has eyeballs.

237
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Okay, so.

238
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:13,200
So this is sort of, you know, what it's taking taking image, dilating it and then fuzzing it out.

239
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,200
And then when we apply that.

240
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:31,200
So it's, you know, going to subtract this sort of dilated fuzzed image from the original image to then sort of get rid of in this case, hold that out of focus.

241
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:46,200
I don't know that we want it for the DAPI I think we want it for the cell image, the DAPI seems fine. Okay. All right, well, then that should hopefully bring the out of focus like more together.

242
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:55,200
Okay, so.

243
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:02,200
Do do do.

244
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:11,200
Okay.

245
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,200
Well,

246
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:23,200
the zoom in and just the contrast so it's not just a

247
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:30,200
late gray blob. Okay, I mean you can definitely see the difference before and after

248
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,200
might be a little over.

249
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,200
Yeah, but I work close.

250
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:52,200
Okay, I would say like doubling the block size and the smoothing filter size.

251
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:58,200
And so what does the block size and smooth like what does doubling do Beth.

252
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:05,200
So what I was actually doing is actually suburb is actually breaking the image into individual chunks and trying to figure out the background value in each chunk.

253
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:19,200
And it said subtracting that and so the bigger your chunks are the more likely you're truly going to get a piece of background, the more likely that what you're subtracting is actually really background and not some of your real signal, you can manipulate this.

254
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:29,200
You know, the, the, if you choose bigger ones you're going to get something that is really just more of a background just now to focus light correction but if there are cases where you're trying to sharpen things up you can actually intentionally try to set a sort of

255
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,200
smallish block size.

256
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:41,200
It'll help you approximate more like a local thresholding strategy.

257
00:22:41,200 --> 00:23:00,200
All right. So here, we certainly see before and after, you know, less aggressive erosion of the you know the last time but does seem to be doing a lot of cleanup, like maybe that's the

258
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Yeah, because if you needed to you could then do a sort of small expansion afterward with a second round of ID secondary, if this cleans things up too much.

259
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:24,200
But you'll need to now change your everything in ID secondary adjust your thresholding strategy completely presumably start by just taking your minimum off and setting your correction factor back to one.

260
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:43,200
There's a lot of things open right now. Okay, but here.

261
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:50,200
This seems right off the bat like not unreasonable.

262
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,200
But this is the good one so now we need to see.

263
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,200
But we haven't ruined anything by our ruin.

264
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:07,200
So it was a good starting point. Right. Because before when we tried to you know when we took off that minimum.

265
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:21,200
We were getting just the tiny little, you know, tiny little spots up here but but that reasonable enough ish from what one can tell in this very out of focus image anyway.

266
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:31,200
So, yeah, so that's hard one hard one. Okay, let's see test next image that.

267
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:38,200
Okay, what do we got.

268
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:55,200
So hopefully this should remove more of our out of focus light so that even if the threshold that needs to change is or is a little bit different there at least now in the same regime, they're close enough to each other because we're not just measuring out of focus light that we could use the same minimum in both cases.

269
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:11,200
Alright, so if we take a peek at our, let's see, let's say, just to see here at like what's happening in our illumination application.

270
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:26,200
You can see it's sort of a little bit different than the previous one where like definitely the intensity was you know they were like more smaller, more smaller bright spots where you could really see the background correction, like around those and here, sort of a lot more

271
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,200
general halo across it.

272
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,200
This certainly looks like a much nicer starting image.

273
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:40,200
And if we jump to the ID secondary that we get from it.

274
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Better.

275
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:52,200
Not only better, but I wonder if now a minimum would help a little bit. I think we are in the point 003 regime on the other image so.

276
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Yeah, this is.

277
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:05,200
So, we're just a little hover like, yeah, point 002.

278
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,200
0.003 is sort of out here.

279
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,200
We did a point 003.

280
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:20,200
I bet we could clean this up a lot and not affect the other image.

281
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,200
35.

282
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:31,200
Turn that a little bit more.

283
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,200
We're creeping there.

284
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:43,200
The, the art of image analysis and object segmentation.

285
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:55,200
You know, that that big horrible one that's a primary problem. That's not a secondary problem.

286
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,200
Because, oh wait no there is a little itty bitty nucleus there I couldn't even see it it was so small.

287
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,200
Yeah, hidden in the corner.

288
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
Yeah.

289
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:22,200
What happens.

290
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:36,200
I mean, some of it also is like, these are really not pretty input images so you may end up you know you may end up being in a situation where it's like, okay, I want to make sure on the best images that I'm getting.

291
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,200
I can so you do want to make sure that you haven't lost any quality and sort of your better image.

292
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,200
And then, you know, and if you went to local thresholding.

293
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:54,200
Hey, let's see.

294
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Then you're gonna have to pick again, the hot suit three class.

295
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,200
And it's got all right we think 100 is a.

296
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,200
Starting window.

297
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,200
So tell us Beth what is it like what have we just switched to why would we do this.

298
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:30,200
So now we're determining the threshold independently in each block which is going to hopefully help us in the blocks where things are sort of dimmer to force it to be a little bit stricter in those areas.

299
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:36,200
Maybe.

300
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,200
Yeah.

301
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:49,200
It's definitely still not good but it's it's certainly in a more livable range than where we were before now we completely trashed our first image back to

302
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:58,200
That is that is always the question.

303
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,200
I love that you've made everything in CellProfiler pink.

304
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:09,200
It makes me happy.

305
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,200
I try and make as many things as I can pink.

306
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:26,200
I still, you know, get flack from most software developers for never, you know, never using dark mode.

307
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:41,200
But also that still looks really good. So I would say that for half an hour of time we've now done a much better job of sort of splitting the difference between the other one isn't great but it's definitely now usable.

308
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Yeah.

309
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,200
Yeah.
