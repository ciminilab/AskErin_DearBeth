00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, Beth.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,160
Hello, Erin.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:19,160
It is lovely to see you, as always.

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,660
You too.

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,160
And hello, dear viewer.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,240
Welcome to the latest episode of Ask Erin, Dear Beth.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,760
Beth, tell us about our challenge today.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,360
Yeah, great question.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,460
So today, we're going to look at the IDR.

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,860
So if you're not familiar with the IDR,

11
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,360
it's the Image Data Resource.

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,560
It's a great place to look for public data sets.

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,260
So if you care about public data,

14
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,260
because you want to be able to find data that looks like your own

15
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,560
so that you can sort of build workflows on it,

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,060
you just want to find data that you think is going to be comparable to your own.

17
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,160
So you can actually calculate your own metrics

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,060
and see if there's actually interesting biology

19
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,260
that you can find where somebody else has done all of the work

20
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,760
of doing the microscopy.

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,160
So we're big fans of the IDR,

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,960
but it can be a little bit challenging sometimes

23
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,760
to find and download the data that you want.

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,060
And so we're going to show you today

25
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,260
how I have done that for a particular data set.

26
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:19,260
Let me go ahead and share my screen.

27
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,860
So you can find the IDR at idr.openmicroscopy.org.

28
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,160
And there's two parts to it.

29
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,360
There's the cell IDR and the tissue IDR.

30
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,260
If we look at the cell IDR,

31
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,360
which is what I think it has 82 different experiments in there.

32
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,560
And if we look at the tissue IDR,

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,960
there are 53 different experiments in there.

34
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,960
So there's a lot of data that you can actually take a look at

35
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,460
and see how does it relate to your data.

36
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,660
So in this particular case,

37
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,660
we were looking for a particular microscopy phenotype.

38
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,560
We were really just looking for cells.

39
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,760
And so we browsed around in the IDR

40
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,960
and we came across this data set that we liked a lot,

41
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,960
which was this screen for link RNAs.

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,460
And if you look at the side here,

43
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,060
see a lot of information about different aspects of the screen,

44
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,660
the screen technology type, how it was made.

45
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,560
So really well annotated and metadata is one of our favorite things.

46
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,760
Is it there?

47
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,660
Oh my gosh.

48
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,660
Like, don't get me started on metadata

49
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,960
and how much I love it because then we would just run out of time

50
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,560
to record anything other than air and waxing poetic about metadata.

51
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,160
But I do think that's a really important part in terms of,

52
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,960
you know, anytime we're talking about a public data set

53
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,260
for it to be, you know, reusable,

54
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,860
it's certainly important that there is enough metadata with it

55
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,360
that like a user down the road like us is now able to go and look and see,

56
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:58,160
like, okay, here is information that I might need in order to understand

57
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,860
what is in this data set, what can I do with this data set,

58
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,460
how is this data set generated?

59
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,060
And the IDR is definitely a favorite of ours for many reasons,

60
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,960
but a big one being that they do require lots of metadata

61
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,460
to be published with the images themselves.

62
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,360
It makes everything so much more usable and so much more important

63
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,160
because, you know, you don't just have data but potentially the right data

64
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,360
for your question.

65
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,860
And there's lots of things that are searchable.

66
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,360
There's great things about the IDR that we don't have time to go into today

67
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,260
because today we're mostly going to look at data accession.

68
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,160
How do we actually access the data?

69
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,560
But so we found this plate of data as we were sort of browsing around

70
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,960
that we liked a lot.

71
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,160
We can take a look at it in the web client and see does it have the phenotype

72
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,760
that we want and these are some lovely cells

73
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:53,660
which will be great data points for other things we want to show in this podcast.

74
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,260
So how do you then actually get a bunch of data out of the IDR?

75
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:04,960
So if you go to their website, there's a whole page about how you download data.

76
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,660
And if you don't want to download just one image, you can do that here,

77
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,760
but I don't think the IDR makes it as nice as it could, especially in this particular case

78
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,260
where we have each image file is a whole well.

79
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,960
And so it seems like that causes some crankiness in the download procedure.

80
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,160
And some data sets in the IDR are stored as one file per plate.

81
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,260
And so for that, you certainly can't go or don't want to go in and do that

82
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,260
just from this web portal.

83
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,560
You want to use some sort of a file transfer.

84
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:42,560
I think that is an important thing to note about when thinking about getting the files themselves off of the IDR,

85
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,660
that different data sets, they're not actually converted to some standardized format.

86
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:57,860
The data is generally as it was acquired and different researchers are using different microscopes

87
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,660
are saving their data in different formats.

88
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:07,760
And so again, as you mentioned, here, the data set we stumbled upon and were interested in

89
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:18,460
has the files themselves are saved out differently from perhaps if we were to browse into another data set.

90
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:25,560
So that can even be, maybe you want to parse the data by like, what is the file format?

91
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,260
I want to get familiar with using a certain way that data is structured.

92
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:35,260
There's all sorts of different things to consider when browsing in such public repositories.

93
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,760
And because the IDR is lovely and full of lovely people, they actually provide you three different ways to do it.

94
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,760
And which one you do should be really up to you and what you're comfortable with.

95
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:55,760
This is the one they recommend is one called Globus, which I've never actually tried before, but it looks really easy.

96
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,760
But we're used to shipping around files by something called FTP, which is the file transfer protocol.

97
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:09,760
And so we have, we are pretty used to in our work using nice tools like a program here called CyberDuck

98
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,760
in order to actually ship data around.

99
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,760
And CyberDuck is nice because it's free, it's open source.

100
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:29,760
And so I've actually been able here to make a bookmark where I can actually, maybe I can even show the bookmark.

101
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,760
Nope, maybe I can just edit the bookmark over and over again.

102
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,760
But I can put in from IDR what they would think that the connection should be.

103
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:51,760
And then when I copy and paste this in and tell it that I want to connect anonymously,

104
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,760
I'm not going to do it because I'm already connected and I think it'll freak out if I try to do that.

105
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,760
That should be in theory all you need to do.

106
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:05,760
And then I have this where I've now bookmarked this where I can connect to the IDR and I can download any of this data that I want,

107
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,760
which is terabytes going on a petabyte.

108
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,760
So I'm not going to download all of it.

109
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:17,760
But then if I want to figure out what is the right data that I want, all I do is I just go back and I look at my web client.

110
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,760
I can just pull the IDR number, which is 56.

111
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,760
And then if I wanted, I could download that entire IDR project or that entire IDR screen.

112
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:33,760
But here I've just downloaded a couple wells of data so that I can use that for prototyping another project.

113
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,760
But absolutely, especially if you're still prototyping the microscopy that you're going to do and the imaging you're going to do,

114
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:50,760
it's really important to understand can you measure the thing you want to measure in the data that you have.

115
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,760
And so one way to do that and one thing you shouldn't neglect to do is by collecting pilot data.

116
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,760
But if you want to get a sense of if I had the prettiest possible version of the data that I think I'm going to have,

117
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:07,760
can I figure out a workflow to quantify it accurately and public data is a great way for doing that.

118
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,760
Anything else you would add today? Ask Erin.

119
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,760
Well, Beth, you mentioned that you use this to like from Cyberduck to like just download.

120
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,760
So do you mind showing us like?

121
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
Sure.

122
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,760
How do you even get that last couple, the last step here of the download?

123
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,760
So all I did here, so here is to just collapse out.

124
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:41,760
I compared with, I grabbed the first thing that was there and I said, and it said screen three and here I'm looking at screen C and I hoped that those were the same.

125
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,760
And it looks like they probably are because if I look at this number here and this number, those aren't.

126
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
So that's plate one.

127
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,760
But plate two matches this one and I'm looking at plate two.

128
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,760
So that should be the same.

129
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:04,760
There's some metadata here from the microscope, which is great if I wanted to know exactly like what the exposure times were and what settings were and things like that.

130
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,760
But in this case, again, each image is a well.

131
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,760
And all I have to do is click on a few sets of walls and hit download.

132
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,760
And Cyberduck goes ahead and downloads all that data for me.

133
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
Wow.

134
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,760
Awesome sauce.

135
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
Yeah.

136
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,760
So using these open source tools and these open data resources, you can actually get access to tons of data really quickly.

137
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:40,760
You can use it to build workflows that you can then transfer into your own data and make sure that you are getting your data as pretty as the public data and that that is going to help you actually be able to run the analyses you want to run.

138
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,760
Awesome.

139
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,760
Look like seeing that.

140
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
Thank you so much.

141
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
Talk later.
