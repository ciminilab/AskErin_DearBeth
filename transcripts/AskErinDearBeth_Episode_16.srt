1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,420
Hey Beth!

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,540
Erin!

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,020
Is it time?

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:20,340
Is it time for another episode?

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,340
It is time!

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,060
We're here to talk about science!

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,420
That's my theme song of the day apparently.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,040
I like your theme song.

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,040
Yeah, yeah.

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,720
Yeah, I wanted to talk about the Cell Painting Gallery today, also known as CPG, for those

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:48,440
who like acronyms or get tired of repeating themselves over and over and over again.

12
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,640
And yeah, so that's what I'd love to talk about today, you game?

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
Yeah, absolutely.

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,280
I love the Cell Painting Gallery and I want more people to love it too.

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,280
Yay!

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,680
So let's talk about it.

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,440
What is the Cell Painting Gallery?

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:13,960
So the Cell Painting Gallery is a really large data repository that we, the imaging platforms

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,640
as is co-maintained between our lab and the Carpenter's Thing Lab in the imaging platform

20
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:31,080
at Broad, and what it is is a whole lot of data, talking 700 terabytes-ish at the moment.

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,080
That's a lot of data.

22
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,920
A lot of data and growing.

23
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:43,440
That is all Cell Painting Assay or very close derivatives of that assay.

24
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,600
So I think, I don't think we've ever actually recorded an episode about the Cell Painting

25
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,240
Assay, which is kind of funny because it's kind of our area of expertise.

26
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,560
So I think we should probably do that real soon.

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,560
Yeah.

28
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:06,480
But, but the Cell Painting Gallery is a public data repository of high content microscopy

29
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:16,040
images of cells treated with compounds or genetic perturbations and with many organelles

30
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,440
or intracellular compartments labeled with vital dyes.

31
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,680
That's sort of the run-on sentence that explains the big picture of what's in the Cell Painting

32
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,240
Gallery.

33
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:42,440
So this is our landing page, which is a GitHub repo where most everything is here in our

34
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,440
docs.

35
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,560
I'm going to go through, I'll skim through our docs more importantly, but here on this

36
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:58,800
landing page, so this is, we use github.com/broadinstitute/cellpainting-gallery.

37
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,400
And the reason I'm starting here is to show you this is the list of available data sets.

38
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:12,320
So we have, we have this, you know, forward-facing list of data sets.

39
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,960
These are all fully complete published data sets.

40
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:24,760
So we list the identifier that we have given them to be able to find them in the gallery,

41
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:31,480
a brief description, publication in which these were described.

42
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:40,720
We also often have other GitHub repositories that have more information about these, this

43
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,680
data, particularly sort of the numerical data that supports the images.

44
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:56,440
So it could be links to, you know, links to GitHub repos where we show like the exact

45
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:03,360
code that was used for making profiles or, you know, the handling of the numbers we've

46
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,920
extracted from the images.

47
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:14,800
Or it can link to things more generally, like here, this explains comprehensive information

48
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,600
about a subset of these data sets, tools that you might use to interact with them, that

49
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
sort of thing.

50
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,200
So, so, you know, we link out to as much supporting information as we can.

51
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,000
It seems very thoroughly documented.

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,400
It is, because that's kind of my jam, yo.

53
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,000
Anyone that's listened to more than one episode has probably heard me say how much I love

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,720
documentation, and that's, that's my doing here.

55
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,480
Heavily documented, because that's what I love to do.

56
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:54,360
Yeah, give a girl right access to a repo, and next thing you know, documents just keep

57
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
appearing.

58
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:02,880
So we also give you an estimate of the size of both the image size as well as numerical

59
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,880
data.

60
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,080
So all of the images in here have been run through CellProfiler and had quantitative

61
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,920
measurements extracted on a single cell basis from all of these.

62
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,040
So that's what would be in the numerical data.

63
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,040
But important to know sort of what is the size of what you're handling, because some

64
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,320
of these data sets are larger than others.

65
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,120
For example, if it's like, hey, this looks cute.

66
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,240
It's, you know, it's a pilot episode, pilot episode, pilot data set.

67
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,640
So maybe I'll just download that to like get my hands wet playing around with some images.

68
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,800
But, you know, before warned that that's 6.1 terabytes of images in this pilot.

69
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,160
So maybe that's not actually, maybe you want to start it a little before you try to download

70
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,200
it to your desktop to poke around with the images.

71
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,440
So again, everything in the gallery is at scale.

72
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,720
And so that is a thing to keep in mind.

73
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,960
Also, this goes way back.

74
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:07,520
We curated in data that has been published like since the inception of the cell painting

75
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,720
assay, which is many years ago now.

76
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:18,480
And so other data sets have been in other public repositories at other points and

77
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,040
therefore given other identifiers.

78
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:27,680
So you may recognize data sets from the BBC, the Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection.

79
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,600
You may recognize it from the IDR, which we have another Ask Erin Dear Beth episode

80
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,160
about the ID.

81
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,320
One of our first episodes.

82
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:35,840
Yeah.

83
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,280
And how much we love it.

84
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,520
So we have some, you know, we do have data in IDR as well.

85
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,680
So that's something to bear in mind.

86
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,440
But if you look, we actually have quite a collection of data.

87
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,720
These are all complete and published data sets that are available in the gallery.

88
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:01,880
There is also a ton of unpublished data that we are currently either collating in from

89
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,320
other sources, contributors are sending us data, or we are in the middle of generating

90
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,640
and analyzing them ourselves.

91
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,960
And as soon as we feel like they are complete, they will be moved here.

92
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,360
But if you want so you can poke around the gallery, everything in the gallery is fully

93
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,400
publicly available.

94
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,400
But if you want a complete, described data set, start with an identifier that here we

95
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,960
list on the main page.

96
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,640
So that's already a lot of data.

97
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,240
So there's a lot of data.

98
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,640
Yeah.

99
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,720
There's there's no shortage of data here.

100
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,840
Yeah.

101
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,600
So our docs, right?

102
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,880
Like Cell Painting Gallery has lots of documentation because that's my jam, yo.

103
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,800
And so we have a link to the docs, like here on the webpage.

104
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:55,480
Also, you can get straight there, broadinstitute.github.io/cellpainting-gallery.

105
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,600
And that will take you to our documentation about it, where it describes what's in the

106
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,000
gallery and how do you find stuff in gallery and how do how do you access it?

107
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,640
So there's a few that like, without reading you all of the docs, because if you're

108
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,080
really interested, you can go read them yourselves.

109
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,440
There's a couple of things I want to point out.

110
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:20,440
So first of all, fully publicly available, all for free.

111
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,480
It is hosted by AWS as part of their Registry of Open Data Program.

112
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,040
So thank you to AWS for hosting this data for us.

113
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,000
Thank you so much.

114
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,280
Access does not require an AWS account.

115
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:41,040
So you can access and download all of this without making an AWS account.

116
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,480
It is all free and publicly available, regardless.

117
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,360
You certainly can have an AWS account and you can use it, you know, use it to access

118
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,600
this data, use it to run compute on this data.

119
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,400
But you can, you don't need it and you can, you can do what you want with this data.

120
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,760
It is fully publicly available.

121
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,120
You can download it to your own server and do whatever you want.

122
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,280
So that's an important thing.

123
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,760
We have super stereotyped structure.

124
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,680
And this is probably the driest of the docs in here.

125
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:21,280
But if you are trying to find something, this is really helpful to look for because

126
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,680
it tells you exactly where to find it.

127
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:31,920
So if I know I'm looking for, you know, that CPG 000, that pilot, jump pilot,

128
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,120
and I want to find the images, right?

129
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:44,320
This explains exactly where I would find those images and what, like, based on their paths.

130
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,920
So, so if you're looking for something specific, this can be helpful.

131
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,720
And we talk about CellProfiler features.

132
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:05,720
And the, this is sort of information specific to the Cell Painting Assay and what we used

133
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,160
in the Cell Painting Assay to extract data.

134
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,400
So more on that in a different episode.

135
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,800
But we also here have information about how you can browse through the Cell Painting Gallery

136
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,960
and how you can download data from the Cell Painting Gallery.

137
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:28,320
And so I just want to show you, like, quilt is one example of an easy way to browse through

138
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,000
the gallery.

139
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,120
And so if I'm here looking in the Cell Painting Gallery here in this root folder, I see all

140
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,120
of, you know, all of the prefixes that have been added.

141
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,840
Again, not all of them are complete.

142
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,800
But I've been saying, like, OK, this is that first one I was interested in.

143
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,280
Let's go into the images folder.

144
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:57,720
And you can see, oh, look, there were six different batches in which data was collected.

145
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,960
Let's look at the images from this first batch.

146
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,640
And you can click through.

147
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,920
This is a plate of images as it came off of the microscope.

148
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,280
And anything is I can click on any of these.

149
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:16,400
And this is perhaps not optimized for scientific image viewing fully.

150
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,280
So can't see this image super well.

151
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:31,000
But if we also go into sort of the workspace, there is there is quantitative numerical data

152
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,800
that corresponds to all of these that one can see.

153
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:42,360
So if I want to look at, OK, let's look at the measurements made in some of these, I can

154
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:48,080
actually click on a CSV and have it previewed here for me.

155
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,760
And there's some some tools about actually viewing and doing some simple data viewing

156
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,080
and plotting within Quilt as well.

157
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,560
But really handy way, you know, intuitively to, like, click through and browse through

158
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:08,160
where data is without having to worry about understanding, fully understanding the either

159
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,800
object storage, which is how data is stored in S3 buckets, which is a whole, you know,

160
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,960
if you're used to working just like on a server or on your laptop, thinking about data in the

161
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,440
cloud as objects and bucket storage can be sort of a new intimidating thing.

162
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,480
So it's just a nice way to sort of browse through browse through and look for things.

163
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,280
That seems super helpful.

164
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
Yeah.

165
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,040
And again, here we, you know, we explain a few different ways.

166
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,360
Here's some examples of plots you can make, like in the browser in Quilt.

167
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:51,000
And sort of if you are more of a computational user, how to work with AWS command line interface

168
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:00,800
or this is a Python SDK for the AWS.

169
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,680
So instead of using the CLI, you can use Python and we give some examples there because most

170
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,560
of what we do is in Python in our lab.

171
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,760
So along with browsing, this is information about the actual download.

172
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,720
So if you want to download the files, this is information about how to do it.

173
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,040
And then just a couple of examples.

174
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,400
And here we welcome contributions.

175
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,680
If you have worked with the gallery and you, you know, have things to suggest here, we

176
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,160
have curated some workflows that work directly off of the Cell Painting Gallery.

177
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,720
So you can use, you can download the data if you want.

178
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,080
You don't have to download it.

179
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:45,920
And we provide some examples of different, this is like three different tools that people

180
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,360
have written that correspond, you know, were parts of different publications that are actually

181
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,960
showing examples of reading data directly off of the gallery and doing something with

182
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,160
that data.

183
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:05,840
You know, data at this scale can be handy for like machine learning and deep learning.

184
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:14,120
So a few of our data sets, more than a few, that's a decent number, are actually already

185
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:22,240
put into a format directly intended for interaction, you know, interaction with, you know, AI,

186
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,920
deep learning tools.

187
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,160
So we call, you know, call that out here.

188
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,560
Please cite the Cell Painting Gallery.

189
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,720
This helps us get funding so that we can get all the software and computational tools you

190
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,360
including the Cell Painting Gallery.

191
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,200
But this is, you know, citation information.

192
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,600
We do welcome contributions.

193
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:53,240
So if you are, if you are lab is generating cell painting data and you would like for it to be made

194
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,720
publicly available, let me know.

195
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,720
I would love to help you get the data in the gallery.

196
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:08,480
And we have here, you know, some examples of publications that are for the data in the gallery.

197
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,960
This is absolutely not comprehensive in any way.

198
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:17,840
But gives you some examples of if you want to, you know, read through them and maybe get a better,

199
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,760
you know, get a get an example glance at these and see like what what kinds of papers what kinds of

200
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,600
publications are describing these data sets.

201
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,440
This can can give you a good idea of that.

202
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,920
Yeah, I mean, that's sort of big picture of the gallery.

203
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,160
Like it's gigantic.

204
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:43,760
It's all cell painting data or very closely adjacent data sets.

205
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,800
And so what does that mean?

206
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:56,000
We have some, you know, for example, most most cell painting data is captured in an arrayed format where you

207
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,520
have a plate that has wells in it and each well has its own perturbation.

208
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:07,880
But we have the first published example of pooled cell painting where we're actually using sequencing by

209
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:16,640
synthesis on a per cell basis to distinguish what the what the perturbation is in an individual cell

210
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,800
within a pool.

211
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,560
So that's here.

212
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:25,640
We have ones that are, for example, like the site profiler is very similar to cell painting, but it is

213
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,880
tweaked a little bit specifically for like the acidic cells to better capture like metabolic

214
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:39,760
information. So it has Bo Dippy in it in many, you know, in the panel, which stains fat.

215
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:47,040
So helpful for specifically for looking at metabolism, you know, in fat metabolism and lipocytes.

216
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:54,480
We have some examples of data sets that are have paired perturbations.

217
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,600
So L 1000 is like mRNA profiling.

218
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,640
So we have data, you know, paired data sets that are not just cell painting, but they have like, you know, another

219
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,360
data type captured at the same time.

220
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,240
Yeah, we we have a lot of data.

221
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,000
It's really a lot of data.

222
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,480
And yeah, we welcome we welcome you to use it.

223
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,280
If you have any questions, let us know.

224
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,000
If you want to contribute, please let me know.

225
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,760
And yeah, I think that's the big picture of the Cell Painting Gallery.

226
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
Yeah.

227
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,440
Now available through the NSF's National AI Ready Resource Program.

228
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:48,840
That's true. We were just accepted to the NAI RR, another acronym, so many acronyms in science.

229
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,320
So we imagine so that was like just announced.

230
00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:01,760
We imagine that over over time with inclusion in the in the pilot that there will be

231
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,440
a further expansion of people using this for AI research.

232
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:22,320
And so expect to see our curation of, you know, either MLDL ready data to grow or our ability to curate further

233
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,840
like MLDL workflows.

234
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,320
We imagine will be expanding as part of part of that inclusion in the pilot.

235
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,960
So we're pretty excited about that, too.

236
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,040
Yeah.

237
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,040
That sounds amazing.

238
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Yeah.

239
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,680
What a great resource for people who want to look at cells.

240
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,960
Yes, absolutely.

241
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:51,320
And coming up in the not too distant future, we have when we get there, you know, when this is public,

242
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,320
we'll we'll definitely do another another episode on it.

243
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:11,040
But we're working hard in collaboration with another group right now to make browsing and poking around within the gallery across, like across all of the data there, even easier.

244
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:19,520
So we recognize that right now this is really most accessible to people with some level of computational comfort.

245
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:29,840
But we're working really hard on expanding that so that it's even more accessible to the average biologist who is not computationally terribly comfortable.

246
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,960
And like we hear you, we see you, you are our people too.

247
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:44,080
And stay tuned because we really hope hope that we have something exciting to show you in that realm as well soon.

248
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,560
Well, thank you for putting so much time and effort into making this so well documented and so usable and just like sharing all of these things with the community.

249
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,040
Yeah, it has been my pleasure.

250
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:08,800
Certainly when I agreed to help move a few files off of one S3 bucket to another at the very beginning of this project, I absolutely never pictured that it would be what it is now.

251
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:15,120
Because it is, it has been a pretty significant chunk of my time to make it what it is.

252
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:26,280
But I feel really proud of it and really excited for people to be able to have this resource, like believe really strongly in, you know, fair data, public data.

253
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:31,800
And I think the Cell Painting Gallery is, you know, our big contribution to the community in that regard.

254
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:33,920
So cool.

255
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:35,840
Awesome.

256
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,400
Have an awesome day.

257
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
Thanks, you too, hun.

258
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,040
Thanks for, thanks for talking CPG with me.

259
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,680
Always, anytime.
