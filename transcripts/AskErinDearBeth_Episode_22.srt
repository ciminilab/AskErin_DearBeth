1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,400
Erin, it is so good to see you.

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,800
Good to see you too, hon.

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,240
Um, well, I hope you're still gonna say that in a minute.

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,680
Um, because what I wanted to talk about today is probably your least favorite

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,280
part of CellProfiler.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,800
Oh, no, not names and types.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,400
Not names and types.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,800
No, don't make me work on names and...

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,960
Okay, you can do the names and types.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,680
I'll just sit here and look cute.

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,160
And you will look absolutely cute.

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,160
And I know that you know all this stuff, but it's definitely, I think,

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,600
the hardest part of CellProfiler.

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,720
Would you agree?

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,760
Absolutely.

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,840
I still get very frustrated and struggle with names and types,

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,760
which is really silly because I do, I do actually know how to use it at this point in

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,520
time, but I said, you know, from my first week in lab, I established an adversarial

19
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,440
relationship with names and types.

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,880
And six plus years later, I won't let it go.

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't like that module.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, you don't have to like it, but unfortunately, if you want to use CellProfiler,

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,080
you either need to know how to sort of do some scripting or you do need to understand it.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,360
So I'll do a quick overview video today and point you at a much longer,

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,840
really comprehensive resource that the team has put together.

26
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,080
But I just want to sort of talk about what this is, why it exists, why it's hard, and,

27
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,720
you know, how you can learn to sort of make things make sense.

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,840
Sounds great.

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,360
All right.

30
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,680
So ultimately, the problem that we're trying to solve is this.

31
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,960
Everybody's experiment looks super different.

32
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,920
I know even just my own experiments in grad school, like some of them were time-lapse,

33
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,880
some of them weren't.

34
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,280
Some of them had multiple z-planes, some of them didn't.

35
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,760
They came from different microscopes that saved their files out in different ways.

36
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,640
Some of the microscopes I manually typed out the file name each time.

37
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,240
Some of them it was exported automatically.

38
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,440
Sometimes all of the images were one file, sometimes each image was a file.

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,800
There's like a gajillion ways for your data to be arranged on your hard drive.

40
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,600
And the good news is CellProfiler can handle all of those things.

41
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,760
The bad news is CellProfiler is not psychic.

42
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,240
So you need to actually tell CellProfiler what you're doing.

43
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,680
I mean, can we add that?

44
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,760
I mean, so maybe that's not in the CellProfiler 5 work, you know, path.

45
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,720
But like CellProfiler 6, can we add in psychic abilities so that we don't have to?

46
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,320
You know, I think that there's a thing we can do.

47
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,200
One of the things that we're hoping will be in future versions of CellProfiler is like a little

48
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,440
wizard that will help guide you to like the best possible configurations.

49
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,760
But if everybody's experiment was the same, this would be simple,

50
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,400
but not everybody's experiment is always the same.

51
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:18,480
And even the same person day to day might, you know, put a space instead of an underscore or a dash

52
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,920
in their file name and CellProfiler can handle that if it knows to, but it has no way to know

53
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,440
what's going on in your brain.

54
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,040
Like maybe dash versus space is super important.

55
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,920
So you just have to kind of be kind to it and tell it, you know, what it should pay attention to

56
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,800
and what it shouldn't.

57
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,800
Makes sense.

58
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,440
So before I get too far into it, what I want to say is all of the examples I'm going to show here

59
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,520
today are from this fantastic tutorial that several current Informer members of the lab put

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:53,920
together.

61
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:02,240
If you are a video person, you might enjoy the video version of this tutorial with some,

62
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,400
some, you know, people you might recognize.

63
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,400
This is on our Center for Open Biomegenealysis or COBA YouTube channel and we'll make sure to

64
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,600
drop the link in the show notes.

65
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,200
If you like me or a written information person, you might enjoy the written version of this.

66
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,080
And you can find both of these linked on the CellProfiler tutorials page, which is

67
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,240
tutorials.cellprofiler.org.

68
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:35,120
I'm not going to do every single thing because as you can see, this original thing is an hour.

69
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,400
Though it is guided into chapters so that you can see exactly, okay, I know that I have

70
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,880
a particular like thing that I want to be able to show how to do.

71
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,560
You can guide yourself to the right chapter.

72
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,200
I'm not going to reproduce the whole hour, but I'm just going to give you a quick tour of the

73
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,960
input modules and maybe pick one or two that I think are kind of super important.

74
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,680
That sound good?

75
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,720
Sounds great.

76
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,400
Yeah.

77
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,840
So these are CellProfilers input modules and if I just load up the welcome screen

78
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,240
so that I can give a sort of quick example, those of you who watch the podcast regularly

79
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,320
are probably pretty familiar at this point with the CellProfiler example fly welcome screen

80
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,800
pipeline.

81
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,520
But there are four main input modules.

82
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,040
Two of them are mandatory and two of them are totally optional.

83
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,280
I'll talk about the mandatory ones first.

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,520
One of them is the images module.

85
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,680
The images module is not so bad.

86
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,560
You give it images.

87
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,240
If you want to exclude some files, you can add some filters here so you can say like,

88
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,560
oh, I've actually got TIFFs and PNGs in there, but I only want you to look at the TIFFs,

89
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,680
not the PNGs.

90
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,760
You can put some filters in, but otherwise, it's just a place to bring files.

91
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,800
It's not so bad.

92
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,320
And you can even just drag and drop.

93
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,080
Love me a good drag and drop.

94
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,040
Oh yeah.

95
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,040
The other mandatory one is Erin's nemesis is the names and types module.

96
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,280
So this is where you do the bookkeeping to tell CellProfiler,

97
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,760
what it should be there and how to find it.

98
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:19,440
So in our original thing here, we have a file name that ends in D.TIFF, F.TIFF, and R.TIFF.

99
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,920
So I believe this is like DAPI-FITC-Rodamine.

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,160
So in our names and types module, we TellCellProfiler, we've got three things.

101
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,000
And if I had more, I could just keep adding more with this add another image

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,080
or by duplicating an existing entry.

103
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,240
And I tell it that I've got three channels here.

104
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,320
I've got one that I want to call Origblue.

105
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,680
I can call it pretty much anything as long as it's only ASCII characters,

106
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,680
you know, letters and numbers, and doesn't start with a number.

107
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,680
It has to start with a letter for reasons.

108
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,280
I've been burnt by that one before too.

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,640
That's high.

110
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,240
And files that are blue and in D.TIFF, files that are green and in F.TIFF,

111
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,600
and files that are red and in R.TIFF.

112
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,080
Not so scary.

113
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,960
Not so scary.

114
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,160
And, you know, just to your point of you can name it almost anything.

115
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,640
For example, a Origblue, we might name like DAPI to say like this is the

116
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,680
stain that we used, you know, we might name it DNA.

117
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,360
Because that is what we're visualizing with the DAPI.

118
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,280
We might name it Nucleus, because that is the structure that we expect to be

119
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,240
picking out of that channel, that image.

120
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,480
And so one of the cool things about biology is there's all sorts of ways

121
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:53,680
to describe your experiment, but also maybe one of the hard things about sort of

122
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,360
standardizing between experiments.

123
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,840
So often we actually have, I'm not sure if we even have, it's the sort of like

124
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,840
unwritten naming system that we use in lab.

125
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,600
For example, here you see we named all of these starting with Orig.

126
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:17,200
So any workflow we have where we're going to be modifying the images in any way,

127
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,160
the input image that we bring in, we will name Orig.

128
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,080
And then, you know, once we like if we apply a correction to it,

129
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,360
we will then say the corrected image is just the, you know,

130
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,360
Like, the Orig is, it gets cropped, it gets called crop.

131
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,160
Yeah, yeah.

132
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,240
And so we'll have a, you know, a naming system to sort of help track that path.

133
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:45,200
And so you might want to think about in your experiments, standardizing,

134
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,880
so that you can then more easily share your pipeline from day to day,

135
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,800
from colleague to colleague, and not have to rename everything every time.

136
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:57,920
Yeah.

137
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,520
Sounds like you're advocating for metadata tracking.

138
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:01,840
Is that?

139
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,080
I was trying not to say it, but metadata.

140
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,480
Yes.

141
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,960
That's really what I want.

142
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,800
Because I'm trying not to, trying not to take us down a deep rabbit hole on metadata,

143
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,120
just like dipping our toes in the edge of it, so it's not to thoroughly distract from

144
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,320
what you were actually trying to say.

145
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,280
Yeah.

146
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,760
No, it's a very good point.

147
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,080
And people name things, all kinds of things.

148
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,320
And generally speaking, we let you name things whatever you want within reason.

149
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,320
Just your pipeline should be useful for you.

150
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,600
But it'll be most useful for you if it gives you hints when you go to look for things later,

151
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,800
what everything actually is.

152
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,920
So here this is correctly set up.

153
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,360
So if I hit update, what this will show me is that I started with nine images,

154
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
but actually those are three sets of three.

155
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:57,280
And here are my three rows where under the blue, it has my D dot tiffs under the green,

156
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,680
it has the F dot tiffs that match and under red, it has the same thing.

157
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,920
If I had messed this up, if I said that this should be T dot tiff,

158
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,800
cell profile is going to yell at me and say, I don't, I can't find that.

159
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't know what that is.

160
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:23,600
So this is, if I called it D dot tiff for two of them, it's going to let me do it.

161
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,040
But so you have to be careful about what you're doing.

162
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,680
It's really important because otherwise you might be like,

163
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,400
ooh, there's a change between my green and my red.

164
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,360
That isn't actually a change between green and red.

165
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,800
It's a change between green and blue.

166
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,440
So the downside of all of this is like, this is a place to be really pedantic

167
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,800
and really careful.

168
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,240
It's good to do sanity checks when you're looking through these.

169
00:10:51,920 --> 00:11:00,800
Especially what I would say is if you have a ton of files, scroll down to the very bottom

170
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,360
of this list.

171
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,600
Here we only have three images.

172
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,080
So, you know, they match up.

173
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,840
But if I had 500 of each, if the naming scheme isn't perfect,

174
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:17,600
or maybe like one file got corrupted and got deleted, you might actually then start

175
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,840
getting some of them off by one.

176
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,240
So like I have 500 blue images, 500 green images, 499 red.

177
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,240
And if the last red one is missing, that's fine.

178
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,240
But if it's one in the middle, unless you're careful, they can be off.

179
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,720
And so checking these, especially scrolling all the way to the bottom, always a good idea.

180
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,320
You can work around that to some degree if you've used metadata.

181
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:47,520
So this is one of the two optional modules where you can take information that is from

182
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,920
your file and sort of read it.

183
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,320
Might be a few different cases you'd want to do that.

184
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,720
If you have information that's in the file headers or you have a big container file,

185
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,720
like some of the commercial scopes like Nikon, like a Zeiss, we'll put all of your data in

186
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,520
to one big mega file.

187
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,520
The metadata module will help you get all of that data out until cell profile.

188
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,720
This isn't one file.

189
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,520
It's actually, you know, 50 fields of you, each of which has six channels.

190
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:21,520
It might be that you want to bring in information from a file.

191
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,720
So if you have a spreadsheet somewhere that says what everything is treated with and you

192
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,120
want to add that information to your files right there in cell profile, so you can't accidentally

193
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,120
lose that spreadsheet later and accidentally like not remember what's in all of your data,

194
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,120
you can do that.

195
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Or just if you want CellProfiler to understand what is in your data in terms of things like

196
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,120
what plate is it, what well is it.

197
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,120
It's used to think of regular expressions, which look super scary.

198
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,120
If this scares you, you don't have to do it.

199
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
I will say CellProfiler has a guesser.

200
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
I don't know if the guesser works on this image.

201
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
I probably should have checked that before we know.

202
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,120
So guesser doesn't work on this image, but it does have a guesser that if you have a lot of common microscope formats,

203
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,120
so profiler can just help you figure out.

204
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,120
But like all modules in CellProfiler, the metadata module has a lot of help in this help button,

205
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,120
the question mark button, the most important button in CellProfiler help button.

206
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,120
And some of the data that we have here is the data that we have here.

207
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:35,120
And some of the links that are in here will include links to resources to like how do you figure these sorts of things out.

208
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,120
And here in the help for the regular expression thing, I think it's in there.

209
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
We have links to things.

210
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:51,120
If you also just Google, this is also something where probably chat GPT or another LLM can help you figure this out though,

211
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,120
you know, as always be careful with those, make sure what it's telling you makes sense.

212
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:03,120
But if I had done this, and I can just write a quick regular expression here,

213
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:11,120
and say that this goes,

214
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,120
and I didn't just, you know, I wasn't born knowing how to do this, it just took a little bit of time to figure out.

215
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:25,120
But you too can eventually, even if you if you've not taken like professional coding classes or anything, learn how to do this.

216
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:45,120
I can second that because when I started in the lab over six years ago, I had to make Beth drop into a zoom call with me every single time that I was trying to, you know, change the regex for for my pipelines, but with some practice,

217
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,120
pretty quickly got able to do it most of the time myself.

218
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,120
It is not entirely unintuitive once you get used to it.

219
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:05,120
But then also, it can be it can do quite complicated things that are still beyond beyond my abilities.

220
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:14,120
But, you know, now what you can hopefully see is like, it's there's something called plate that's matching to this, there's something that I've called your position.

221
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:20,120
That it's matching to this and something I've called channel number, which I should probably rename to channel name.

222
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,120
That's just what it was already called.

223
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:39,120
And so in in the names and types module, if I was worried about that case of Oh, maybe one of my things dropped and I'm not sure where it is.

224
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,120
If I've made metadata, I can use the metadata to actually do the matching.

225
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:55,120
And I can say make sure that if you have things that they all have the same position that was that pause thing that I put in.

226
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,120
And I should still get the same three things out here, which I did before.

227
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:08,120
But even if I get rid of one of the things from the first image set, which would ordinarily screw me up.

228
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:16,120
Now if I go here so profile is going to warn me that it's not finding one of the things that things that should find.

229
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:21,120
But it makes two image sets that are right.

230
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:29,120
If I switch back to order based matching.

231
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,120
This has two going with 76 going with two. And so this is one.

232
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:44,120
So doing the metadata, even if it's a little hard and scary can help.

233
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:51,120
The last optional module is called groups. It's not that common to need this one.

234
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,120
So for example, basically it's if you care about which images get processed with which other images.

235
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:06,120
So if it's like I want to do segmentation and measurement, you probably don't care if like in what order your images get processed.

236
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:13,120
But if you're doing say Z projection, you want all of your z planes to get processed together.

237
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,120
All of the ones for movie one, but then not with any of the ones for movie two.

238
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:30,120
So if there's any sort of sort of associations so time lapse movies or making a plate based image correction thing, or doing a z projection, the group module can be helpful.

239
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:39,120
And so I'll actually quick demonstrate that one.

240
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:48,120
I believe that's 3d example one. Let me just check because I didn't memorize that.

241
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,120
Yeah, I think that's 3d example one, but I guess we'll find out.

242
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:03,120
And yes, there's notes here in a lot of this in terms of like where the data is from and stuff just to try to make it friendly.

243
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:13,120
I know it's probably in the groups one.

244
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:25,120
So while you're loading that in, I will say we also have an earlier ask Erin dear Beth episode that introduces using load data CSVs.

245
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:36,120
And that is an alternative way if you never want to deal with names and types, even though Beth has so nicely demonstrated that it's really not that bad and Erin just has a chip on her shoulder.

246
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:54,120
If, if you still have that chip on your shoulder, for example, I go check out our earlier episode of ask Erin dear Beth about low data CSVs and passing load data information into CellProfiler as an alternative way of of that doesn't require using these input modules.

247
00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:10,120
So this wasn't the thing that I was expecting it to be.

248
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:18,120
But considering my spell profilers drag and drop seems to be on the fritz will pretend that it is.

249
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:33,120
So, here I have to bring in a second one.

250
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:58,120
I'm not sure my drag and drop wasn't acting broken today because that makes all of this much less fun to demo.

251
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,120
So, multiple ways to do everything in CellProfiler.

252
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:17,120
So what I now have here is I have 42 images from two different folders and they're labeled sort of zero to 21 in each one.

253
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:23,120
But they have different folder names and so in the metadata module here we actually extracted the folder name.

254
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:29,120
So I can do things by folder arrangement if that's what works for you.

255
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:46,120
So depending on what I wanted to do here, I have two different groups and I could use those groups to do something like add the make projection module and I could project across my groups over time.

256
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:59,120
So if I hit step and I just keep going, I can just keep making a projection that sort of covers the whole thing.

257
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:15,120
But if I ask CellProfiler to show me what's in this image set, it's never going to show me anything that sequence to it's only going to show me things from sequence on so I could never actually accidentally put the things from two different images together.

258
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,120
Nice.

259
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:33,120
And so there's a lot of different things we can do with these input modules because there's a lot of different things you can do with biology and I definitely recommend that if you're having trouble getting data into CellProfiler to use these resources,

260
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,120
come to the imaging platform office hours, visit the image.sc forum.

261
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:47,120
Once you have your data into CellProfiler, actually a lot of stuff gets easier but getting the data in can be the hard part. That's why we have lots and lots of resources.

262
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,120
And hopefully you'll find them and get some great data made.

263
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,120
Awesome. Well thank you. Anything else you would add, Eric?

264
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:01,120
No. I mean, again, we'll just emphasize it's me and my own personal chip on the shoulder.

265
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,120
But I think you did a great job of illustrating the power behind names and types.

266
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:22,120
And I think especially showing that CellProfiler, we have tons of guardrails built into CellProfiler that if you know how to use them by setting the right settings, using metadata to make sure your images match,

267
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:31,120
using grouping to make sure you're not, again, you know, working on the wrong set of images.

268
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,120
Also, you've only got the subset that you want.

269
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:43,120
There are all sorts of guardrails and learning how to use them to make sure that your pipeline does what you want.

270
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,120
It is a little bit of a learning curve but it's super powerful when you do learn it.

271
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,120
Awesome. Well, thanks for hanging in there with me. I hope that was okay.

272
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,120
It was okay because you were here with me, Beth.

273
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,120
Great. See you later.

274
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,120
Bye!

275
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,120
Thank you.
