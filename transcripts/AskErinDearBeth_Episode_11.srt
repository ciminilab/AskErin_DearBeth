1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey Beth!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:18,280
Erin, it's so good to see you!

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,400
You too!

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,880
How are things?

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,880
Lovely!

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,480
We've got some sunshine here right now, which is always nice.

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,480
Sunny and maybe a bit too sunshiny here today.

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,280
What I wanted to talk to you about today is a tool called ilastik, and more in general

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,320
the idea of pixel classification.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,560
What that is, why that is, why it might be helpful.

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,040
Because ilastik is one of our favorite tools, and we end up using it a lot, especially for

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,000
projects that are a little bit trickier.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,840
So I wanted to sort of let everybody know that this resource exists.

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
Awesome.

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,840
I love new tools.

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,840
All right.

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,000
Let me go ahead and share my screen.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,600
And I think something worth double pointing out that despite, as image analysts, despite

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:15,440
being the team who maintains CellProfiler, we use lots of different tools.

20
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,680
And any image analyst, you may have your favorite tool.

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,320
I think we've shown in lots of episodes that we often, the very first thing we do is look

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,000
at images in Fiji, even before moving into a CellProfiler pipeline.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,440
And just something to point out that you may be an expert in a given tool, but that doesn't

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,880
mean it's the best.

25
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,680
And there's lots of awesome tools out there, and ilastik is one that we love and use all

26
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,640
the time in our lab as well.

27
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
Yeah.

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,080
CellProfiler might even be our favorite multi-tool, but sometimes you need just a really darn

29
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
good screwdriver.

30
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,720
Sometimes you need another tool that's better at what you need to do than the thing that

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,800
is your go-to standard.

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:05,080
And we love ilastik for things where doing segmentation can get a little bit complicated.

33
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,600
Absolutely.

34
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,880
So here's one example.

35
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,440
So these are some cells that were taken with phase contrast imaging, where we're using

36
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,160
just white light.

37
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,440
We're not doing any fluorescence.

38
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,240
And by eye, I can really confidently say, you know, this is the boundary of this cell.

39
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,760
This is the boundary of this cell, because our brains evolved over millions and billions

40
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,400
of years to do that.

41
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,480
A program like CellProfiler that's used to dealing with fluorescence images is going

42
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,520
to get really confused because it's going to say, like, hey, you told me to look for

43
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,280
bright things on dark backgrounds, and that's not this.

44
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,880
We may, in a future episode, talk more about how what are the ways that you could make an

45
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,200
image look more like this.

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,800
But one of the tools that makes it really easy to make these cells look bright on a dark

47
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,680
background is ilastik, and this idea of pixel classification.

48
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,320
Ooh.

49
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,160
So there's a lot of different things you can do with ilastik.

50
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,760
I'm just going to be, like, skimming the surface here.

51
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,320
But this is a set of things that we generally find really helpful.

52
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,760
Oh, no.

53
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,440
I think I can just drag it around rather than having to spend five minutes sort of exploring

54
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
my whole.

55
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,560
I can.

56
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
Thank you, ilastik.

57
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,320
So I've brought in a bunch of these different images.

58
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,840
And ilastik is going to ask us to pick some features.

59
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,440
This isn't going to mean anything or it's going to mean more once I actually start working

60
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
with ilastik.

61
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,760
So I'm going to go ahead and just select these and then come back to telling you what they

62
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,760
are and why.

63
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,560
I'm going to hold you to that.

64
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
Okay.

65
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
You do, please.

66
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,560
Okay.

67
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,560
All right.

68
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,280
So here I'm given this idea of two labels.

69
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,560
Two labels doesn't mean that much to me.

70
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,880
Let's say I would rather call these background and cells.

71
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,080
Because there's two kinds of things in this image.

72
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,480
There's background in their cells.

73
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,960
Depending on how pedantic you want to be, there are more kinds.

74
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,960
There's little bits of shadow and things like that.

75
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,160
But there's two major kinds of things that I want to know.

76
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,200
I want to know is this part of the background or part of the cell?

77
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,560
And so the way I'm going to teach ilastik to do that is I'm going to drop my brush size

78
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,800
down to one.

79
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,600
And in a feature episode, we'll explain why it's important to drop your brush size down

80
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
to one.

81
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,280
But it's really important to drop your brush size down to one.

82
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,080
Just take my word for it.

83
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,720
It's not usually that we say, like, this is a rule and follow this rule and it, you know,

84
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,680
we'll explain why later, right?

85
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,360
Or not explain why, but this is a rule.

86
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,760
Like very rarely do we have moratorium or mandates.

87
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,280
There we go.

88
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,720
Very, very rarely do we have mandates without sufficient explanation because we love teaching

89
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,640
and training.

90
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,960
But this is just this is a mandate.

91
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,760
Just trust us or episode.

92
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,600
Keep an eye out for the next, you know, for a future episode where we explain why.

93
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,800
So I'm going to ask ilastik, what is the difference between background and cells?

94
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,360
And so I have to teach it.

95
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,720
What is it differently in background cells?

96
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,560
And so the way I'm going to do that is I'm going to annotate it.

97
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,800
I'm going to start literally by just annotating one pixel in each cell.

98
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,200
I'm now going to hit this magic live update button and magic is going to happen.

99
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,520
You ready?

100
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,600
Ready for magic?

101
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't know.

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,840
Let's do it.

103
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,760
Let's do it.

104
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,280
What?

105
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:00,720
So ilastik has turned all of the pixels of the background yellow and all of the things

106
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,640
that it thinks are cells, it's turned blue.

107
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,040
I'm going to add just a second one.

108
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,760
Okay, hold the phone Beth.

109
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,800
That was with literally two pixels.

110
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,640
Yeah.

111
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,760
Yep, it was.

112
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,000
Literally two pixels.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,240
It already.

114
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,560
Yeah.

115
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,240
And if I turn on my segmentation, it's pretty good.

116
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,640
Wow.

117
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,960
What actually happened?

118
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,880
How does the magic work?

119
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,480
So if I turn off live update and go back to the feature selection mode, I told you I would explain.

120
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,600
Okay.

121
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:36,200
What ilastik said is, okay, you gave me two and then later a third pixel for each one

122
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,560
of the things that you told me to measure.

123
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:46,240
So little circles around that pixel, very small pixels, 0.3 pixel diameter, including

124
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:54,320
big pixels, 10 pixel circle diameter, measure things about the color of the pixels in that

125
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,400
area, measure things about the edges that are around that pixel, measure things that

126
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:04,200
about the texture of that part of the image, and then make a classifier.

127
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,360
So this is why we call pixel classification.

128
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:14,560
So if it says, hey, the texture here is really different than the texture in the background,

129
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:21,080
which by my eye, I'm pretty sure is true, then it will use something like the texture

130
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:29,080
to say, I can classify if this pixel and this pixel versus this pixel have different properties

131
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,120
and I can learn to split those things apart.

132
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,600
And in fact, it will actually suggest what are the most important features and I bet

133
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,080
they're going to come up as texture features, but we can kind of see.

134
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,440
So it's going to ask what the features it should use are.

135
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,080
And I'm just going to hit run feature selection and see what happens.

136
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,880
Live demo. So who knows, but.

137
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,400
So actually, it's about different smoothing things.

138
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,200
So there you go.

139
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,400
It wasn't exactly what I predicted, but how the image changes when you smooth it.

140
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,760
Interesting.

141
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,200
Yeah, I imagine has some relationship to texture.

142
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,000
But, you know, a different way of mathematically approaching that.

143
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,160
Yeah, I also have only given it a very small number of pixels to learn from,

144
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,840
possibly if I gave it more pixels.

145
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,120
I'm going to, for example, it said that this was, it thought was a cell.

146
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,280
Change that and put a background label there and now see if, oh, I have to turn out

147
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,720
my update for magic to happen.

148
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,760
Magic happened.

149
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,120
And so there's a couple of little holes in here.

150
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,960
I could spend more time, but with just a couple of pixels, literally four.

151
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,360
If I zoom out, you can see I've done a pretty good job on this image.

152
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,360
And if I switch to some of the other images in my data set.

153
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,480
Oh my gosh.

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,480
Those are looking pretty good too.

155
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,520
Four pixels, completely different images.

156
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,360
Like that's us.

157
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:17,240
I want to show you actually even a more fun example of so both of these image sets

158
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:23,840
are actually things that I found in the bird bio image benchmark collection,

159
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,840
or the BBBC.

160
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,240
So.

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,680
Go ahead and restart ilastik.

162
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,600
So here we can see why CellProfiler might not do a good job because it wants

163
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
things to be bright in the background dark.

164
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,760
And that's not what we have here.

165
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:49,240
Here, our background is dark, but what we have here are actually, these are

166
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,360
synthetically made cells, but they're cells of lots of different shapes and colors.

167
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,360
The nuclei are always blue, but I think that's a good idea.

168
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,080
But the authors here computationally made a bunch of cells with lots of different

169
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,080
colors so that they could test how well classification algorithms worked to

170
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,080
classify a cell as red, green or blue.

171
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,800
So I thought that was a cool data set.

172
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,560
And you can imagine that, especially if I care about the difference between the

173
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,360
nucleus and these cytoplasms, that it might not be super easy to tell cell

174
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,800
profiler maybe the difference between where what parts of the image are cell

175
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,160
and which parts are background, but maybe not the boundaries of individual cells

176
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,760
because there are lots of different colors.

177
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,200
So again, I'm going to make a pixel classification project.

178
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,600
And as always, we will put the links to our data sets in the show notes

179
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,240
because we love to share good data.

180
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,240
All right. So again, I'm going to turn on my feature selection.

181
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,840
And so the last time I had two classes, now I'm going to have three classes.

182
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:14,440
I'm still going to call this background.

183
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,440
I'm going to actually change the color also just because I don't

184
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,720
kind of actually don't want to see the background.

185
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,560
I'm going to display very much.

186
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,360
We're going to call this nuclei.

187
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,480
We're going to call this cell.

188
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,800
All right. So we still have our super small brush.

189
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,520
Going to do a pixel of background.

190
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,600
Let me zoom in a little.

191
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:57,560
Let's do a pixel of nuclei and let's do a pixel of cell.

192
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,520
And then let's watch the magic happen.

193
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,560
Show us the magic.

194
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,600
All right. What did we get?

195
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,160
So it definitely knows background.

196
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,080
And for some of the cells, it knows cells.

197
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,160
And for some of the cells, it's really not sure.

198
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,960
If I turn on ilastik's uncertainty view,

199
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,840
it's kind of, so here uncertainty is marked as teal.

200
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:40,520
It is pretty certain or more certain anyway in the cell that we marked as part of a cell.

201
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,960
It's really uncertain in the green cell because we haven't actually annotated it with anything green.

202
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,160
Yeah.

203
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,120
This is where our discussion about overfitting and stuff comes in,

204
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,120
which we're going to talk mostly about in another episode.

205
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,640
But let's see if I can get something to work.

206
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,680
So I'm going to break my rule.

207
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,680
I'm going to try to make my cell here.

208
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,920
I'm going to turn on the big brush and I'm going to give it lots of cell pixels that are red.

209
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,360
What happens to our segmentation guess now?

210
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,280
It actually did pretty well.

211
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:22,360
And I'm pretty sure the reason that it did pretty well is because we have texture features here

212
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,200
that are similar, I mean red and green.

213
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:35,800
I suspect that if we set this to only use intensity features and not some of the texture or smoothing

214
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:41,480
features, we actually wouldn't get such a good result.

215
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,480
What you're saying is it's probably actually just ignoring the color now when you've added

216
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:54,200
many of those other pixels and focusing on what is similar between the two.

217
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,720
Yeah, which we can check.

218
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:10,040
Yeah, so these are now definitely getting into some very texturing features.

219
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,720
It's kind of ignoring the colors.

220
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:23,720
If it had had a hard time learning this green, the more that I sort of annotated red,

221
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,400
the more green I would have had to add in order to get it to go well.

222
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,880
One way I still might be able to show you that is the nuclei I haven't annotated very much yet.

223
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,520
If I put, and it's not doing a very good job because it's now seen so many cell pixels,

224
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,880
it thinks most things are cells.

225
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,400
See if I drop just a couple more nuclei pixels.

226
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,960
So now I maybe have like five nuclei pixels.

227
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,560
What do I get?

228
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,000
All right, it didn't take very many this time.

229
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:01,720
And that's probably because this is a pretty easy task and the nuclei are a different texture.

230
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,320
So I wasn't able to get it to overfit this time because ilastik just has so many useful

231
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:13,880
features that it does such a good job that I'm not actually able to demonstrate overfitting.

232
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:21,800
But we will have another episode where we talk about the importance of being able to actually say

233
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,160
that the number of annotations that you make in each kind of phenotype that you're looking at

234
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,960
actually matter.

235
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,120
But I think we can.

236
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,640
Oh, sorry.

237
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:39,640
I just one thing I'm noticing is with this latest prediction, it looks like it's predicting

238
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,760
nuclei in the middle and then cells around it, but then sort of a layer of nuclei again.

239
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,920
Yeah, I noticed that too.

240
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,280
I suspect why is because it thinks that nuclei are things surrounded by cells.

241
00:15:53,960 --> 00:16:04,360
So if we and so if we put a bunch of annotations in the background just far from the cell,

242
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,800
I'm not sure if that'll fix it.

243
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,840
We can figure that out.

244
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,920
So that didn't do much to fix it.

245
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:16,280
But I suspect if we put examples right there sort of close to the cell.

246
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,680
And that was just one more pixel.

247
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:25,240
But one pixel in the right place made that huge difference when a whole bunch of pixels

248
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:32,200
in a place it was already doing well actually change anything appreciably.

249
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,080
Yeah.

250
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,560
And that's a really great point.

251
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:40,440
So let me let me demonstrate that now even a little more, which is let me erase all those

252
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,160
pixels.

253
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,840
Let me turn on the uncertainty view.

254
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,320
Right now, the places that I put those pixels initially are pretty already darn certain.

255
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,840
So it doesn't matter if I sort of draw out here all day.

256
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,960
The things aren't going to change much because, you know, I've now made this uncertainty even

257
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,760
less, but I haven't actually fixed my segmentation.

258
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,280
Problem at all.

259
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,800
But if I go to where the uncertainty is high,

260
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:20,840
then I can fix my segmentation much more easily with many fewer pixels and fewer pixels is

261
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,000
always better as we'll talk about in a future episode.

262
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,040
Lovely.

263
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,960
But yeah, ilastik is really great.

264
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,400
You can see it's robust to all kinds of shenanigans that we can try to throw at it,

265
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,920
even when we're trying to throw at things.

266
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:41,080
But it's a great way to make your image into sort of the thing I care about is found specifically

267
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,080
even if the thing is not is all the same color or as many different colors,

268
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,720
both of which sub profiler struggles with.

269
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,160
And so those are there are many use cases for using ilastik.

270
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,360
Definitely check out their website.

271
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,000
We'll put it in the show notes, but those are some of our favorites.

272
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,680
Absolutely.

273
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,920
I think one thing too, and maybe this is for a future episode is that,

274
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,480
you know, often we are using multiple tools in a single analysis task.

275
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:13,000
So here ilastik has done a brilliant job of getting these objects for us.

276
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,960
And then we may take these objects and bring them into a CellProfiler pipeline

277
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,400
and make the measurements that we're interested in in a cell pro in a CellProfiler pipeline,

278
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,400
bringing in these objects.

279
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,880
And then even within the CellProfiler pipeline,

280
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,880
you can do the things that you're familiar with, perhaps familiar with already in cell

281
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,920
profiler about, you know, around object identification, we could fill the holes there

282
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:42,520
or smooth it out or, you know, add or subtract a bit of, you know,

283
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,000
some number of pixels to the edge of the objects.

284
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,160
So lots of lots of extra things.

285
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,600
And the holes are definitely there more in the green than they are in any other color,

286
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
because it knows the least about green.

287
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,760
Yeah, we moved a little bit.

288
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,960
And here we would have a lot of uncertainty just because it never saw a blue cell.

289
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,600
So the red cells definitely perform much better than the green and blue ones.

290
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,120
Yeah, absolutely.

291
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:15,160
So that'd be something you could either continue to improve your pixel classification here in

292
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,520
this pipeline, or if this was the best you had, bring it into another tool like CellProfiler to,

293
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,200
I mean, already one more pixel and it's so much better.

294
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:30,600
But, you know, you can bring those into CellProfiler to then do further work with.

295
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,640
Couldn't have summed it up better myself.

296
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,960
Sorry if I took the words wrong.

297
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,080
No, no, it was beautiful.

298
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,680
You put on air and I jumped ahead.

299
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,640
I just got excited.

300
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,800
Good image analysis is always exciting.

301
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,280
Of course.

302
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,240
All right, so good to see you.

303
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,440
See you next time.

304
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,800
All right, sounds good.

305
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,280
Bye.
