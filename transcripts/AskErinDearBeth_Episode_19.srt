1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,760
Hey Beth, how's it going?

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,520
Hey Erin, it is so lovely to see you.

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,320
Oh my gosh, same thing right back at ya.

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,840
Yeah, so today on Ask Erin Dear Beth,

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,120
I thought it might be fun or help, I don't know, fun.

6
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,480
Yeah, fun, it's always fun.

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,080
Fun, absolutely fun.

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:44,080
To go through a list of conferences that we,

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:51,120
lots you, sometimes us and or the Cimini Lab,

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,840
have attended recently and or attend regularly just to say,

11
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,680
you know, hey, these are the vibes at this conference,

12
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,760
this is a thing we particularly like about it,

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,920
just to give folks out there an idea of like,

14
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,680
hey, these are some of the conferences you might want to come to

15
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,400
and maybe you'll run into us if you do.

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,800
Yeah, and I mean, there's a lot of good stuff out there,

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,320
depending on if you're into image analysis,

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,520
because you're into imaging or because you're into biology

19
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,240
or because you're into computer science,

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,920
like depending on where your flavor is,

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,840
like, there's actually, as we were getting this episode ready,

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,680
I was surprised just how many there are.

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,480
Yeah, yeah, and this is absolutely not even a comprehensive list

24
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,600
of the conferences that we go to.

25
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,360
This was, you know, things that we have gone to either a ton

26
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,720
or very recently, and so this is not exhaustive,

27
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,360
there is way more out there, but just sort of,

28
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,760
you know, nice broad strokes overview.

29
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,120
And feel free to drop in the comments

30
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,160
if you think there's an awesome thing

31
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,040
that we're missing and maybe we'll see you there.

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,480
Yes, absolutely.

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,880
So, I'm starting here with SBI2,

34
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,920
because that was where we most recently hung out, IRL,

35
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,320
even if we didn't get any video evidence of it.

36
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,200
We have lots of video evidence of both of us being there.

37
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,640
It's true, it's true.

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,000
You know, we got another podcast episode on that,

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,640
but just not the two of us in the same video frame

40
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,640
at the same time, which is silly,

41
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,240
we should do better next time.

42
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,640
Oh no, we were too having too much fun hanging out.

43
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,360
Yeah, yeah.

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,360
So, SBI2, Society of Biomolecular Imaging and Informatics.

45
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,160
Yeah, so basically, like, this is our whole lab,

46
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,000
our whole imaging platform, our sister lab,

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,320
Carpenter Singh lab, like, our, you know,

48
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,040
the entire, our whole office area disappears

49
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,640
for the duration of SBI2, everybody goes.

50
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,560
So, this is where you will, you know,

51
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,600
find the imaging platform very thoroughly represented

52
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,920
at this conference.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,040
I think we were 10% of the attendees

54
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,600
at the 2025 SBI2 meeting?

55
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,800
Yeah, yeah, we took, you know,

56
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,680
grabbed a photo of Carpenter lab alums

57
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,680
and it was a solid chunk of the current conference.

58
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,240
So, SBI2, I think is cool and unique

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
in that it is a balance of both academic

60
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,560
and industry and pharma.

61
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,440
It seems like 50, 50, that's a total vibes-based number,

62
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,600
but, you know, a pretty good split

63
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,600
of getting both of those populations of researchers

64
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,360
together in the same room.

65
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,360
So, you get to hear both a lot of, you know,

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,760
more basic tech dev that happens more likely

67
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,520
in an academic setting as well as application

68
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,160
that is more likely to happen in a biotech pharma setting.

69
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,080
So, pretty cool bringing those groups together.

70
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,080
Yeah, it's, and it's on those sort of like spectrum

71
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,240
between like super focused on one area

72
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,960
to like a little bit for everything.

73
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,520
It's more on the super focused side

74
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,920
and it ends up being about sort of 250 to 300 people,

75
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,040
which is a meeting size that I personally like.

76
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,360
It's pretty focused.

77
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,800
You end up mostly talking about what do we do

78
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,120
with lots of images and figuring out sort of hidden

79
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,960
information from image data.

80
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
If that's something you like,

81
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,120
you will hear about it for three days.

82
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,200
That's not something you like.

83
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,720
It might not be the right conference for you

84
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,200
unless you wanna learn more.

85
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,160
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

86
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,240
Though it does have, since it is a society meeting,

87
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,280
it does have very clearly an education focus

88
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,360
and recognizes that people are attending

89
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,360
that are coming from the sort of wet lab,

90
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,120
you know, wet lab and dry lab sides,

91
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,200
where people that have the expertise

92
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,840
in running the experiments in the wet lab

93
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,960
that wanting to understand more about the computational end,

94
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,080
as well as people who have computational expertise

95
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,520
but really wanna start diving into the biology,

96
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,520
you know, driving that.

97
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,680
So again, that's a super good point.

98
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,560
Yeah, yeah, a bit of a spread in that

99
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,280
and a nice way of bringing it all together.

100
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,200
So yeah, so that's SBI2.

101
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,640
Okay, ASCB, American Society for Cell Biology.

102
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,640
This is one that is probably like the least focused

103
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,760
conference that we regularly attend,

104
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,440
I would say, you know,

105
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,360
Cell Biology being a very large term.

106
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,360
And so you are likely to find a little bit of everything

107
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,760
related to Cell Biology at this conference.

108
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Yeah, no, it's especially,

109
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,520
it feels like it's always a lot of cytoskeleton stuff.

110
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,600
It's one of the, definitely if you love cytoskeleton,

111
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,680
you will love ASCB, but it's a great place

112
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,760
to hear about things that you don't usually think about

113
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,600
and actually expose yourself to a different part

114
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,080
of cell biology than, you know, perhaps you would otherwise.

115
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,440
Yeah, yeah, that's a great point.

116
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,000
There's also usually, at least the last several years,

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,880
some good working groups on like,

118
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,680
how do we bring microscopy data people together

119
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,200
and things like that, which have been really cool.

120
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,080
Yeah, nice.

121
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,120
And I, you know, also have heard it as

122
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,520
because it is so big and so many people attend,

123
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,760
you know, smaller groups will use it as an excuse

124
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,360
for like, hey, let's pull together a pre-ASCB,

125
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,000
you know, educational day,

126
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,440
tacking it on as a great way for researchers

127
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,200
and collaborators all across the country

128
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,480
who are already planning on being at the same place

129
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,360
at the same time, will add on a day, you know,

130
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,800
to either end to be able to more directly focus

131
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,720
on a project.

132
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,520
So, you know, you may have a friend or collaborator

133
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,200
that this would be the perfect opportunity to excuse,

134
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,240
to like get you co-located,

135
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,240
that's the word I was going to say, co-localized, but, you know.

136
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,400
Oh, co-localized works, I'm all about it.

137
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,040
Yeah, all right.

138
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,040
SLAS, yeah, there's both society for lab,

139
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,120
lab automation and screening.

140
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,520
Thank you, yep, always stumble through that one.

141
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,520
So, SLAS is,

142
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,280
I think, does have some academics that come,

143
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,480
you know, we often come to SLAS meetings,

144
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,080
but it is, I think, much more heavily weighted

145
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,520
to biotech and pharma,

146
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,120
and very also focused on, well, automation, right,

147
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,960
being a part of it.

148
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,200
So, you know, as an academic, dry lab academic,

149
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,040
it's actually pretty fun to walk the conference floor

150
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,680
and look at all the robots that are for sale.

151
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,720
So many robots.

152
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,360
So many robots, you know, I'm never interacting with them

153
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,880
or seeing them in the lab,

154
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,280
because we just sit in front of our computer screens.

155
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,200
But, so if you're interested in,

156
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,800
you know, if that is already an area of your expertise

157
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,440
or you're interested in learning more about the automation,

158
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,360
then that is a cool opportunity.

159
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,000
They also are very focused on tech development.

160
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,520
So there's focus and awards for startups

161
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,880
that are driving technology

162
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,640
and for, you know, technological development,

163
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,800
which can be cool to sort of keep an eye on.

164
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,640
They also have interest groups.

165
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,840
So SLAS again being, you know, fairly broad,

166
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,440
but then have much more narrowly defined interest groups

167
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,720
that either meet at the main SLAS meeting,

168
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,040
we'll have an afternoon,

169
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,760
or even sometimes smaller subset conferences,

170
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,120
like we've been to SLAS AI,

171
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,040
that are then, you know, much smaller meetings

172
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,960
under the SLAS umbrella,

173
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,800
that can be a cool way to connect to people

174
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,920
with a much, you know, a much narrower interest.

175
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,240
And I will say, if you're early career person,

176
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,280
SLAS offers mentoring that you can sign up for.

177
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,080
Like you can, if you're going to the main meeting,

178
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,800
you can sign up to say, like,

179
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,240
here are some people who volunteered

180
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,400
to just like meet with people,

181
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,000
to sort of give them like a little bit

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,600
of career coaching or whatever.

183
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,760
And so I've done that in the past

184
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,040
and it's been really fun to get to meet with people

185
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,600
who are like, how did you get to be where you are?

186
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,640
And I think it's great, I wish more meetings did that.

187
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,680
So it's a very cool aspect of SLAS.

188
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,640
Nice, yeah, totally.

189
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,760
Okay, Cytodata.

190
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,600
Cytodata society also has a regular conference

191
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,320
and this is much more data focused

192
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,360
as one might infer from the name.

193
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,360
So there is, you know, let's see.

194
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,440
Yeah, we started with SBI2,

195
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,560
sort of the one end of SBI2,

196
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,520
that is the what do we do with large amounts of image data?

197
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,920
Like that is the focus of Cytodata

198
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,680
and really driving, you know,

199
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,840
working together and driving the data exploration

200
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,880
and of high content image experiments.

201
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,680
It also, they often have workshops

202
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,840
and they often have hackathons.

203
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,080
So if you like to, you know, meet up with new folks

204
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,000
and dive right into a project

205
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,120
and, you know, make some fast and dirty code,

206
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,800
then that can be a really fun opportunity to,

207
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,120
and the cool thing about it, you know,

208
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,240
the hackathon sort of environment,

209
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,600
like it doesn't, you bringing together people

210
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,960
of different skill sets and, you know,

211
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,000
different expertise and different levels

212
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,280
of proficiency with coding.

213
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,280
So you don't have to, you know,

214
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,080
you can participate and have a fun time

215
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,640
and even be on a winning team,

216
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,040
even if you don't feel like you are the most confident coder

217
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,000
because you are a biologist who learned to code

218
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,120
rather than being a trained software engineer

219
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,280
or data scientist.

220
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:56,280
And so that could be a fun thing about this conference.

221
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,200
Yeah.

222
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,400
And the connections I've made to folks

223
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,080
at Cytodata Hackathons, like people that now I'm like,

224
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,600
oh, if I need something in this area,

225
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,880
I will just totally email, you know,

226
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,640
a person that I met at one of these hackathons

227
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,960
because spending two days sort of solving a problem

228
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,080
together really, you know, helps you make friends.

229
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,200
Absolutely, absolutely.

230
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,160
Yeah, speaking of hackathons,

231
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,160
SciPy is another conference that we went to this year.

232
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,240
So this is about scientific Python,

233
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,560
scientific Python computing,

234
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,800
which again is much more broad,

235
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,320
you know, me, both niche and broad, you know,

236
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,120
narrow in that it is science focused and Python,

237
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,080
but also end up interacting with people

238
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,160
that are not bio-imaging at all,

239
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,200
people coming from engineering,

240
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,000
people coming from, you know,

241
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,800
I thought it was really cool I got to go

242
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,800
to some workshops on geospatial imaging,

243
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,560
which, you know, so a lot of the tools

244
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,320
and methods that they use are very helpful and relevant.

245
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,000
So it was really cool to learn about that,

246
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,160
but not something that I would generally be exposed to

247
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,160
all that much because I'm, you know,

248
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,040
focused on the bio part of the bio-imaging.

249
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,720
And there's also hackathons usually tied

250
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,360
to one end of SciPy.

251
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah, and I'll say as somebody who is a self-taught coder,

252
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,200
I felt kind of nervous about like going to the sprints

253
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,480
and everybody there is super lovely and welcoming.

254
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,240
And there are people there who are professional software

255
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,200
engineers who've been coding their whole lives,

256
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,680
but there are also people who are sort of area experts

257
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,280
in geospatial imaging or astronomy or biology

258
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,920
and who just, you know, like to code as part of their job.

259
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,600
And nobody I talked to was like,

260
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,240
oh, you don't have a software degree?

261
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,080
And they're like, oh, cool, nice to meet you.

262
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,280
So it was very friendly and welcoming.

263
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,120
Nice.

264
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,480
They also have a pun-off basically at the end of each day,

265
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,840
which I very much enjoyed.

266
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,200
Yeah, yeah, I did not make it to that.

267
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,840
And I do feel a little jealous

268
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,720
that that didn't fit into my schedule.

269
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Yeah, ABRF is another one that we go to often.

270
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,400
It is, okay, Association for Biomolecular Research Facilities.

271
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,680
Oh, there we go.

272
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,240
I could have actually just read it right there.

273
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,320
I didn't have to pull that one out of my brain.

274
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,160
But there we go.

275
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,000
Resource facilities.

276
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,840
Yes, yeah.

277
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,600
Yeah, so ABRF, so Biomolecular Resource Facilities,

278
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,600
also known as core facilities,

279
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,280
which we are the imaging platform,

280
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,200
Broad Institute calls its core facilities platforms,

281
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,040
but, you know, we have the designation

282
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,080
of being a SSF specialized service facility.

283
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,040
So ABRF is a gathering of folks

284
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,880
that are involved in core facilities

285
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,560
across the United States.

286
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,560
And it is cool in that, you know,

287
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,120
if you are, it's way beyond bio-imaging,

288
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,520
there are all sorts of cool things happening

289
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,360
in core facilities.

290
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,000
So I get to go, you know, looking crazy talks

291
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,720
that I never would have thought about attending,

292
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,320
you know, like solving crimes using mass spectrometry.

293
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,240
Like, whoa, that was really fun.

294
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,240
But also they have a really strong emphasis on networking

295
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,720
and career development and sort of community

296
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,160
for the unique challenges that core facilities face

297
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,240
that are different than a sort of traditionally

298
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,000
grant funded lab.

299
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,840
So it's a pretty cool organization to get involved in

300
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,800
if you are a part of a core facility

301
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,320
or interested in being a part of a core facility

302
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,480
as a career path.

303
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,480
They also have smaller subset meetings, regional meetings,

304
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,560
again, like spread across the United States.

305
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,080
So you can, at those smaller meetings,

306
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,160
even connect more directly with people

307
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,720
that are geographically closer to you

308
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,600
and really get to make friends in community that way.

309
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,720
Yeah.

310
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,880
And since a lot of core facility people

311
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,040
are pretty isolated within their individual organizations,

312
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,800
you know, if a facility might only be one or two people,

313
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,280
it's a great way to sort of have people

314
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,240
who are just excited to connect to their peers.

315
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,080
Yeah, absolutely.

316
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,960
They also have some research groups.

317
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,040
So for example, the Light Microscopy Research Group

318
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,920
for ABRF has done some very cool studies

319
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,520
about like how well can people actually,

320
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,200
like can people tell if they're doing a good job

321
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,200
doing segmentation and things like that?

322
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,400
There's the, and they do these research studies

323
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,720
to actually try to figure out how well research goes

324
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,560
and can facilities do anything to make research better,

325
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,640
which I think is a great mandate.

326
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,900
Yeah, totally.

327
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,400
Okay, we went to the OME community meeting this year

328
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,040
where, okay, quick anecdote,

329
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,720
in the general, you know, arrive in the evening

330
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,360
general intro talk, it was, you know,

331
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,720
raise your hand if you came to this meeting for this reason

332
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,360
and raise your hand if you came for this reason.

333
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,240
And I sort of leaned over and whispered to Beth,

334
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,000
like, I don't know when to raise my hand.

335
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,880
I don't know why I'm here.

336
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,000
What am I doing here?

337
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,120
And then everybody, it's a small meeting.

338
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:06,160
So then everybody went to the local bar in the town.

339
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,480
This was at Woods Hole.

340
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,080
So, you know, wandered away into the bar that evening

341
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,040
to hang out with the other folks that were there.

342
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,400
And I didn't, there were a few people

343
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,640
that I had met before and interacted with,

344
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,840
but the majority of the people there I did not know.

345
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,200
So I was like, okay, time to sit down

346
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,640
and make some new friends.

347
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,320
So, plopped down and within five minutes,

348
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,880
I had a whole table full of people

349
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,920
that were just absolutely geeking out

350
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,320
about my personal recipe collection

351
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,320
and metadata curation of just my, you know,

352
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,200
my own hobby of curating and baking and cooking.

353
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,840
And so, you know, five minutes into the drinks,

354
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,320
I had like, I had found my people.

355
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,000
So whether, you know, they're like equally nerding out

356
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,840
about metadata.

357
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
I'm like, oh, okay.

358
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,680
So this is why I'm here because I love metadata

359
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,760
in every shape or form in my personal and professional life.

360
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,880
And so do these people.

361
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,400
They are just as nerdy about the same thing as me.

362
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,880
Like, okay, this is why I met OME.

363
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,700
Yep.

364
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,960
Yeah.

365
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,960
So OME is open microscopy environment groups of folks

366
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,160
that are interested in, particularly in standards.

367
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,440
Standards, I know, you know,

368
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,480
some of like not the sexiest topic like metadata and standards

369
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,800
which don't excite lots of people,

370
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,840
but if they do excite you, these are your people.

371
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,680
Oh yeah.

372
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,520
Yeah.

373
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,320
Yeah.

374
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,240
Anything else?

375
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,840
Also has a hackathon at the end

376
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,560
where people put together some cool projects.

377
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,760
We hashed out with somebody at last year's hackathon

378
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,960
and they like helped make part of something

379
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,160
for our bilayers project.

380
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,720
Cause they were just like, oh, that's a cool idea

381
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,880
that builds on standards.

382
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,800
And so again, super nice people for the people

383
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,960
who were there from work coders,

384
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,680
they're like, you can help with documentation.

385
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,520
But if you go to the meeting, if there's a hackathon,

386
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,520
definitely go to the hackathon too.

387
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,360
Yeah.

388
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,240
Yeah, absolutely.

389
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,440
Okay.

390
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,040
I2K, which is images to knowledge.

391
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,880
So, okay, you were the expert on this one Beth,

392
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,840
you should describe I2K.

393
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,760
Images to knowledge is a super interesting conference

394
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,360
that's never been the same twice.

395
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,880
And so in that sense, in 2018,

396
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,280
it was an in-person conference at EMBL.

397
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,280
2020, it was around the clock tutorial with on during COVID.

398
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,520
In 2022, it was a hybrid meeting.

399
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,120
In 2024, it was an in-person meeting.

400
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,240
And so it's just,

401
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,360
it's almost an experimental conference at this point.

402
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,720
It's kind of never been the same thing twice.

403
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,280
But what has been consistent for the past couple of years

404
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:01,280
is since that original 2020 around the clock hackathon,

405
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,840
every year except 2021 has had major aspects of I2K

406
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,640
that have been about doing tutorials.

407
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,000
So in the 2022 hybrid meeting,

408
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,720
the mornings and the afternoons were kept for tutorials.

409
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,600
And then since then,

410
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,720
we've been running these online events every year.

411
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,240
In odd years, they're the only event

412
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,240
and we call them halfway to I2K.

413
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,680
And in even years, they're the actual,

414
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,920
they're run alongside the actual event.

415
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,960
And what they are is we just say,

416
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,320
here's a tutorial with on.

417
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,400
We make a big Zoom platform,

418
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,240
the people who make the tools that you like.

419
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,520
And they don't have to be people who make the tools.

420
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,680
We have a lot of people who show up

421
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,960
and they're like, I really love QuPath

422
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,800
and I wanna teach other people how to do a thing in QuPath

423
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,800
that I just learned how to do if anybody wants to show up.

424
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,360
And it turns out people do wanna show up if you build it.

425
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,000
And so we, every year that we've done this,

426
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,160
we've had 30 plus different tutorials

427
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,880
on different aspects of image analysis.

428
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,680
You can register and attend for free

429
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,000
and go to as many of those as your schedule allows.

430
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,760
And it's just a great way for the community

431
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,200
to share what's exciting to do in image analysis.

432
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,040
I've just started planning a 2026 in-person meeting,

433
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,720
but there's hopefully gonna be some hybrid events too.

434
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,840
Awesome, yeah.

435
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,840
And there will be a special Ask Me Anything episode

436
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,880
of Ask Erin Dearbeth that we're gonna record

437
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,600
at halfway to ITK this year.

438
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,880
So please check that out

439
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,000
because that will have probably already been posted

440
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,720
by the time this episode goes up.

441
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,520
Yeah, yeah.

442
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,080
We will hopefully also do it again next year.

443
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,600
Yeah, love it.

444
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Okay, last couple ones here to mention.

445
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,840
I pulled up Globias,

446
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,760
the Global Bioimage Analyst Society,

447
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,760
but there's a bunch of, maybe we have a lot.

448
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,760
I also pulled up here, BINA, there's NEUBIAS.

449
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,680
What other global ones do we have here?

450
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,080
Yeah, so BINA's not technically global,

451
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,640
but there is global bio-imaging that is sort of,

452
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,480
BINA is the sort of equivalent of global bio-imaging,

453
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,800
but these are all scientific societies

454
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,320
that have conferences.

455
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,840
And so if you wanna get together with folks

456
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,160
to talk about bio-imaging or bio-image analysis,

457
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,040
they have great meetings every year.

458
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,400
They're also great societies

459
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,040
that have a lot of working groups.

460
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,600
And so I'm in bio-imaging North America's

461
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,520
working group for image analysis.

462
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,560
And it's cool to get to meet friends

463
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,280
and talk to people who do that around the country.

464
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,120
And in Globias, I get to do that with people

465
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,760
who are around the world.

466
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,080
One of my favorite things about Globias

467
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,920
that isn't a conference, but that can sort of maybe be a thing

468
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,680
that sort of leads you to going to a Globias event some days.

469
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,960
We have an online database where you can say,

470
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,560
hi, I'm a bio-image analyst.

471
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,640
I wanna be contacted about opportunities to do stuff,

472
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,160
or I just want people to be able to find me on the internet

473
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,520
so that people who work near you,

474
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,160
who want help with bio-image analysis can find you.

475
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,760
Or if you wanna find somebody who does bio-image analysis,

476
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,240
you can use that tool to find somebody who's near you.

477
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,160
And Globias is still a pretty new society.

478
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,840
We only started it a couple of years ago,

479
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,280
but they just had their first sort of big

480
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,800
couple hundred person conference

481
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,800
and hopefully more conferences in years to come.

482
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,440
Yeah, and I think the neat thing about actually

483
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,720
lots of what I put up here is societies

484
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,080
that have conferences.

485
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,400
And so even beyond, for Globias and BINA,

486
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,600
being two of the examples I pulled up,

487
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,880
they have all sorts of professional enrichment

488
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,320
and opportunities for networking and connecting and learning

489
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,120
and super informative newsletters

490
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,160
that are all a way to get involved,

491
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,240
a way to learn more.

492
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,680
And then also they have conferences

493
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,800
where you can do a lot of that in person,

494
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,640
but definitely worth checking out

495
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,880
checking out what the society has to offer

496
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,840
even beyond the conference.

497
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,960
Yeah.

498
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,560
No, it's a great point.

499
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,320
Like newsletters can be a great way to just see,

500
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,600
like is the society like interested in things

501
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,040
that I'm interested in?

502
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,920
Many years I don't make it to ASCB

503
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,040
just because December's hard, but I have their newsletter

504
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,720
and so I can see what's ASCB up to.

505
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,680
And I definitely don't make it to all of these every year

506
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,960
because I need to sometimes get work done,

507
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,120
but it's great to keep up with those societies

508
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,720
and see the important work that they're doing.

509
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,480
Yeah, absolutely.

510
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,920
Well, thank you for talking through that list.

511
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,880
Again, this is not an exhaustive list

512
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,920
of the conferences and societies that we love and attend.

513
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,280
This was just, again, some of the most recent ones

514
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,880
that we have been actively involved with.

515
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,720
So if there are other similar societies

516
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,600
or conferences that you love, let us know,

517
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,000
drop it in the chat and maybe we could repeat this

518
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
in the future sometime with another chunk of ideas for folks.

519
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,840
All right.

520
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,680
That was so fun.

521
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,520
Thank you.

522
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,360
Thanks, bud.

523
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,200
Here we go.
