1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,640
Hey Beth! Hey Erin, how are you?

2
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,320
Peachie keen, it is so good to see your lovely face this morning.

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,080
Always great to see you as well. Wonderful. Well I thought

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:33,360
that it was about time that we talk about just give an overview about the Cell Painting Assay

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,680
because it's something I feel like we've name dropped at least a handful of times at this point

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,280
but haven't actually said what what is the Cell Painting Assay? I can't believe we've gotten this

7
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,280
far into the podcast and never actually done that. That's crazy. Yeah, yeah it's it's funny

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,240
because it's really I mean I'd say like it's our bread and butter in our lab in in that like

9
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:04,880
something we do a lot you know run the image analysis of the the Cell Painting Assay for

10
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:14,000
lots of collaborators and you know the most latest protocol paper was simony at all and you know we've

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,960
been we are heavily involved in the Cell Painting Assay but like we should probably talk about

12
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,760
what it actually is. Is it making cells look beautiful like my background here?

13
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:34,160
I mean that's certainly part of it. Not that you know not that cells aren't beautiful in

14
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,680
their own native state but we do we do add some more color to make them even more visibly beautiful.

15
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:51,760
Yeah so to keep this quick because you know we're always able to give a long answer to anything

16
00:01:51,760 --> 00:02:00,480
but to make this brief a brief introduction to Cell Painting so Cell Painting was originally

17
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:10,480
developed by Anne Carpenter in collaboration with Stuart Shreiber's lab and the it's a single

18
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:19,760
specific assay that is a high content assay and you can sort of one way to think about it is the

19
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:32,560
omics of morphology so it is a way of doing high throughput assay and looking at cells so morphology

20
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:43,440
being shape of cells and getting answers at the other end and so this is a schematic that I

21
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,800
stole from a recent slide deck of Ann's so I think this is you know pieced together from

22
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,040
several different publications and resources at this point but most recently stolen from an Ann

23
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:03,200
Carpenter slide deck and but I think a pretty basic overview of what this is as a concept for

24
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:10,640
the Cell Painting Assay you take cells they can be healthy cells they can be diseased cells

25
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:19,440
they can be cell culture sometimes they're on patient derived cell lines and then

26
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,440
generally we add a treatment that can be drugs drug screening is probably the most common use

27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,080
for the Cell Painting Assay particularly this is an assay that's done in lots of pharma companies

28
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,320
for early stage drug discovery and so very easy for you know high content drug screening but also

29
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:50,080
very much also used academically with genetic treatments and it's done in a high content manner

30
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:58,560
so generally the cells are grown in well in an academic lab 384 well plates I know that in pharma

31
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:08,160
that have robots more robots you end up with you know higher density plates yeah we don't you know

32
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,280
we don't have lots of robots available to us in most of our academic collaborations other than

33
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:22,080
what we can awkwardly do ourselves and so you grow lots of cells lots of and most importantly

34
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:28,960
like lots of different treatment conditions then a specific staining panel that I'll get to

35
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:37,040
in the next slide but where we are adding dyes that are so so the Cell Painting Assay was optimized

36
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:48,480
to be cheap and easy and so we fix cells and then drop drop dyes into you know in with them so

37
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,160
and it labels a bunch of cellular compartments then we do image analysis

38
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,160
where we are identifying individual cells and making a bunch of measurements and then what you

39
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:10,320
end up with is downstream data that is much like you would get with any omics experiment

40
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:19,200
where you have a single cell is each row in this matrix and columns that in our case are morphological

41
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,680
features so there's some way of describing the cell if you think of other sorts of omics like

42
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,880
proteomics you would have the columns would be proteins and the values would be the amount of

43
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:40,720
that protein in the cell so in our case it's some value some mathematical description of

44
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,480
you know of a feature that's describing the morphology of a cell and these stains in it

45
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,880
can I ask a question absolutely so you've used the word or the term high content a couple times so

46
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,600
does that relate to the fact that there's just lots and lots of features here so we're doing

47
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:07,600
sort of many features all at once yes so we're measuring I mean so I can definitely

48
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,320
yes that is definitely one important part of this we are we'd say like measure everything ask

49
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,560
questions later so we are measuring hundreds two thousands of features the current you know

50
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,520
Cell Painting protocol is thousands although there's very you know variations

51
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,400
also we think of like high so high content and high throughput being sometimes sort of intermingled

52
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:43,680
where we also are doing this you know having the perturbations the different treatment conditions

53
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:51,440
are also at scale like sort of as as large as a reasonable depending on you know the skill level

54
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:59,120
of your technician or your robot again depending on who's doing this assay so you know both of those

55
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,000
we are measuring as many conditions as we can and as many features as we can sort of all in

56
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,000
once so this is a lot of data all at once so big times big equals real big real big yep yep

57
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,480
that's bad as math that I can do in my head too big times big real big love that one you know

58
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,800
and then this final little bit of the panel is just to illustrate you can then do any sort of

59
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:30,000
biological discovery that you would do on an omics level experiment you can look at relationships

60
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,160
between perturbations you can look at you know however you would handle omics data you can do

61
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:43,600
that on Cell Painting data so that's sort of the big picture of the experiment and then the

62
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:51,520
details of what we're actually looking at so this is from one of the earlier Cell Painting

63
00:07:52,240 --> 00:08:01,120
papers but we have uh you know so this is a single example of a single condition a single cell line

64
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,840
um you know I'll put the asterisk of coming up in a future episode at some point you know we get

65
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,720
asked like oh how can you modify the Cell Painting Assay like what what can you do to change it and

66
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,080
we'll have an episode on that coming up in the future you know the punchline is whatever

67
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:25,120
you want basically it still works so spoiler alert but this is an example of a single cell line

68
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:35,680
and the standard panel of of dies that are labeling the standard panel of cellular structures

69
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:45,040
so it's this is like any generic wide field microscope where we have five channels

70
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,680
and we put in six stains and they measure eight or the and they label eight cellular

71
00:08:51,680 --> 00:09:00,240
compartments in those channels and so here you see you know we have nucleus endoplasmic

72
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:09,680
reticulum so okay so nucleus is stained with hoaxed although again yeah i'm not going to

73
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,440
go into what what you can swap that's a whole other episode right i'm staying on target staying on

74
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,680
task here you can do it i believe in you yeah so we have endoplasmic reticulum stained with

75
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:30,880
concanavalin a nucleoli and cytoplasmic RNA that we see with cytoh actin which we see with

76
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,760
phylloidin and the Golgi and plasma membrane which we see with wheat germ aglutinin and

77
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,400
mitochondria that we see with mitotracker and so that is the standard like a lot that's a lot of

78
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,720
different cellular parts that we're seeing here labeled and again this is optimized to be

79
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:59,200
just all dyes that you just drop in without any you know awful fixation conditions for for getting

80
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,360
stuff that you know none of the none of the very complicated things you might do to to label specific

81
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,960
proteins or or specific molecules within the cell and then there are a couple pipelines

82
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,720
that we run they are CellProfiler pipelines is standard and we'll drop you know have links in

83
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:26,880
the show notes available you know our our current optimized pipelines one of them we start with

84
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,120
making illumination correction function which like for flat field correction and so we see um

85
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:40,080
depending on your microscope there are you know in this example like pretty heavily vignetting

86
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:45,760
so the corners are darker than the center so we do some math then we have another episode of

87
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:52,000
ask Erin Dear Beth all about this so we'll link that too to figure out how to correct that so

88
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,920
that the corners are no longer dark so that if you are measuring differences in intensities between

89
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,760
a cell in the middle of the image and a cell in the corner of the image differences are actually

90
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,160
due to biology not due to location in the picture yeah that would that would make things hard yes

91
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:17,920
yeah so we do that then we do assay dev assay development which is just refining

92
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:26,720
the parameters you need to segment nuclei and cell bodies and so here's that we also have another

93
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,680
ask Erin Dear Beth episode about how we do this at scale that shows so many episodes

94
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,680
I know I know so I can you know we'll have this link in show notes as well showing how

95
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,800
what we do you know in again like at scale with high content high you know lots of data finding

96
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,920
making sure that we have good segmentation across all of our data but uh it means you know

97
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,560
tweaking a little bit because depending on the batch depending on the cell line depending on the

98
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,400
you know just the day on the microscope uh you might need to change your parameters a tiny bit

99
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,920
to get the most accurate nuclei and cell segmentations but once we've optimized that

100
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:19,200
then we run an analysis pipeline so this is a CellProfiler pipeline just wanted to highlight

101
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,640
that here we have in green like this is find our objects and all of these pink boxes are make

102
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,520
measurements so we have you know measurements on the images themselves to get some basic information

103
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:36,480
on the image these are all images measurements that we make on the objects so we're making

104
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,800
measurements on the nuclei on the cells and on the cytoplasm which is cell minus nucleus

105
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:52,160
so lots of object measurements this likewise is some specific handling for the mito stain to get

106
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,800
some mito mitochondria specific measurements and this is for looking specifically at the

107
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:05,200
background of images measuring some further you know image information about that so we you

108
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:12,080
know potentially you can use that for qc or or other such things so just lots of measurements

109
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:20,880
are made and this is an example of what comes out so we have yeah that's that's kind of scary

110
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:28,800
yeah so this is you know this is a tiny little crop of a you know a single csv opened up an excel

111
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:38,000
here where each row is a cell and we have actually thousands of features going going across um

112
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,080
but you can see these are you know features measured in the cell in the nucleus in the cytoplasm

113
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,600
and we'll have another episode coming up very soon talking about like how do you actually

114
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,720
understand these feature names that's another thing but uh and we and we actually have a

115
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:01,840
workflow for how do we take these you know these individual numbers that we have measured in these

116
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:08,400
objects and how do we make profiles right which is to say it involves some normalization it

117
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:16,880
involves aggregation to say you know for if i'm doing a you know for this drug what is the

118
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,960
set of features and numbers the vector as you you know if you're thinking mathematically that

119
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:30,720
describes this drug treatment because we have you know thousands of single cells and we need to

120
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,920
you know of measurements made in many compartment thousands of measurements thousands of single

121
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,600
cells we want to condense them into something that is not really big times really big so

122
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,880
slightly smaller than really big times really big to be able to to work downstream and so that

123
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,720
is just like our big picture overview uh my big picture overview i did all of the talking here sorry

124
00:14:52,720 --> 00:15:00,160
that anything else you wanted to add in about the Cell Painting Assay big picture no i think the

125
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,560
only thing i would say is make it even one picture bigger which is there's tons of great assays

126
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,160
out there if you know exactly what you want to find like if you know that you care about

127
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,480
phosphosome protein like that's great you should measure phosphosome protein but what this lets you

128
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,600
do is kind of just find your unknown unknowns like i'm not sure exactly which proteins connect with

129
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,000
one another or which patient samples look like each other like let's do something that's instead of

130
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,680
really specific really broad and catch as many connections as possible so that's where it kind

131
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,440
of differs from a lot of other assays you might usually think about yeah absolutely absolutely

132
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,280
and i think that's a great point that it's it's sort of the you know exploring the unknown space

133
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:52,320
um at more you know much more general discovery than asking which then you can dive into and ask

134
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,320
more specific questions once you're in deep diving but it's not set it's set up to capture

135
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,840
as broad uh so you're certainly missing specific things with this assay like this does not capture

136
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,000
every single you know every single part of a cell like smells so pretty complex i don't know if

137
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,360
anybody else has picked up on that yet but you know but you are capturing a sort of optimized

138
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:22,400
view as broad of you as possible yeah totally great point awesome well thank you for that

139
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:32,400
fantastic overview yeah yeah and uh yeah thanks for thanks for joining me along on this again

140
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,760
now and then i have a an episode we can point to you know the next 400 times we name drop the

141
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:44,560
Cell Painting Assay indeed this might be one of our better linked ones yes yeah awesome well talk to

142
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:56,960
you later babes bye

143
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,720
you
